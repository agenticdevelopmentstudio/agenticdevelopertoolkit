# EditorSection

## Overview

`EditorSection` in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks/editor-section` is the platform's
standard master/detail **editor shell**: a records rail on the left, an editing
detail pane on the right, and a fixed editing toolbar across the top. It is a
**pure assembly** — it owns no visual grammar of its own. It stacks three shared
blocks:

1. a `ButtonBar` (the recessed editing strip) carrying a gold mono title on the
   left and the standard **New / Delete / Cancel / Save** action preset on the
   right;
2. a `TopicDetail` two-pane primitive whose collapsible rail lists the records
   (each row may show a `⚠` warn badge), and
3. the shared `EmptyState` placeholder, shown in the detail pane whenever nothing
   is selected.

The consumer owns all state — the record list, the current selection, the draft
and its `dirty` flag, the `busy` (saving) flag, and every mutation callback.
`EditorSection` maps that state onto the three parts and computes the derived
"editing" condition (a selection exists) and the derived Save/Delete enablement.
`children` is the record's editor form, rendered in the pane only while editing.

It is the base editor shell behind hub/admin topics that manage a list of records
(sites, integrations, personas, …) and is reusable platform-wide.

## Ingredients

| Name | Domain | Role | Required | Configuration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ButtonBar | — | The fixed editing toolbar: gold mono title (`leading`) + the New/Delete/Cancel/Save preset | yes | `leading` = title + `titleBadge`; `actions` = `{ onCreate, createLabel, onCancel, canCancel, onSave, canSave, saving, onDelete, canDelete }`; `showDelete` = `!!onDelete` |
| TopicDetail | agenticdevelopertoolkit://recipes/topic-detail | The two-pane rail\|pane primitive: collapsible records rail + detail pane | yes | `items` (mapped from `EditorSectionItem[]`), `selectedId`, `onSelect`, `emptyLabel` = `emptyList`, `railSlot` = `listHeader`, `railWidth`, `panePadding={false}` |
| EmptyState | — | The "nothing selected" placeholder rendered in the pane when not editing | yes | `title` = `emptyDetail`; fixed `className="m-3.5 min-h-[200px] flex-1"` |

Composed shared primitives without their own recipe domains: `Badge`
(`variant="accent"`) for the `⚠ N` count badge on warned rows.

## Integration Requirements

- **must-render-title-in-toolbar**: The EditorSection MUST render `title` (and the
  optional `titleBadge` accessory) as the leading content of the `ButtonBar`, in
  the gold mono title treatment.
- **must-derive-editing-from-selection**: The EditorSection MUST treat a non-null
  `selectedId` as "editing", and a null `selectedId` as "nothing selected".
- **must-show-detail-while-editing**: The EditorSection MUST render `children` in
  the detail pane while editing, and MUST render the `EmptyState` (titled
  `emptyDetail`) in the pane while nothing is selected.
- **must-gate-save-on-dirty-selection**: The EditorSection MUST enable Save only
  when editing AND `dirty` is true; otherwise Save MUST be disabled.
- **must-gate-cancel-on-editing**: The EditorSection MUST enable Cancel only while
  editing.
- **must-default-can-delete-to-editing**: The EditorSection MUST default the Delete
  enablement to "a record is selected" (`canDelete ?? editing`), and MUST honor an
  explicit `canDelete={false}` so Delete is not offered on an unsaved/new draft.
- **must-disable-delete-while-busy**: The EditorSection MUST disable Delete while
  `busy` is true.
- **must-omit-delete-when-no-handler**: The EditorSection MUST hide the Delete
  button (`showDelete={false}`) when no `onDelete` handler is supplied.
- **must-render-warn-badge-per-row**: For a record with `warn` true, the
  EditorSection MUST render a trailing warning on its rail row — a `⚠ N` accent
  `Badge` when `warnCount` is set, otherwise a bare `⚠` — carrying `warnTitle` as
  its title/aria-label; a record with `warn` falsy MUST render no trailing warning.
- **must-surface-mutation-error**: When `error` is set, the EditorSection MUST
  surface it as a red line directly beneath the toolbar; when `error` is absent it
  MUST render no error line.
- **must-collapse-list-header-when-collapsed**: The EditorSection MUST place
  `listHeader` in the rail's leading slot and MUST hide it while the rail is
  collapsed.

```

- Root is a full-height `flex min-h-0 flex-1 flex-col` column so the rail/pane fill
  the container; give the parent a height.
- Toolbar: the `ButtonBar` recessed strip; title is `font-mono text-[13px]
  text-apt-gold` with the optional `titleBadge` beside it.
- Error line: `shrink-0 border-b border-apt-border px-3.5 py-1.5 font-mono text-xs
  text-apt-red`, only present when `error` is set.
- Rail + pane come from `TopicDetail` with `panePadding={false}` (each row/pane
  supplies its own inset); rail width defaults to the standard rail and widens via
  `railWidth` for long identifier rows.
- The pane's `EmptyState` uses the fixed `m-3.5 min-h-[200px] flex-1` inset.
- No raw hex; no `!important` (all color via `apt-*` tokens).

## Shared State

| State | Source | Consumer | Direction | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `items` (`EditorSectionItem[]`) | Caller | TopicDetail rail (mapped to `TopicDetailItem[]`) | Down | Prop |
| `selectedId` (`string \| null`) | Caller | TopicDetail selection + editing/EmptyState choice + can* flags | Down | Prop |
| `dirty` | Caller | ButtonBar `canSave` | Down | Prop |
| `busy` | Caller | ButtonBar `saving` + Delete disablement | Down | Prop |
| `canDelete` | Caller (or derived from `selectedId`) | ButtonBar Delete enablement | Down | Prop, default `?? editing` |
| `error` | Caller | Error line under the toolbar | Down | Prop |
| selected id on row click | TopicDetail rail | Caller `onSelect(id)` | Up | Callback |
| New / Delete / Cancel / Save intents | ButtonBar | Caller `onNew` / `onDelete` / `onCancel` / `onSave` | Up | Callbacks |

## Integration Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | must-derive-editing-from-selection, must-show-detail-while-editing | `selectedId = null` | Pane shows the `EmptyState` titled `emptyDetail`; `children` not rendered |
| T2 | must-show-detail-while-editing | `selectedId = "r1"` | Pane renders `children` (the record form); no `EmptyState` |
| T3 | must-render-title-in-toolbar | `title="Sites"`, `titleBadge=<Badge/>` | Toolbar leading shows the gold mono title with the badge beside it |
| T4 | must-gate-save-on-dirty-selection | editing, `dirty=false` | Save disabled |
| T5 | must-gate-save-on-dirty-selection | editing, `dirty=true` | Save enabled (gold) |
| T6 | must-gate-cancel-on-editing | `selectedId=null` | Cancel disabled |
| T7 | must-default-can-delete-to-editing | editing, `canDelete` unset | Delete enabled |
| T8 | must-default-can-delete-to-editing | editing, `canDelete={false}` (new draft) | Delete disabled |
| T9 | must-disable-delete-while-busy | editing, `busy=true` | Delete disabled; Save shows "Saving…" |
| T10 | must-omit-delete-when-no-handler | `onDelete` omitted | No Delete button rendered |
| T11 | must-render-warn-badge-per-row | item `{ warn:true, warnCount:5, warnTitle }` | Row trailing shows a `⚠ 5` accent Badge with `warnTitle` |
| T12 | must-render-warn-badge-per-row | item `{ warn:true }` (no count) | Row trailing shows a bare `⚠`; a non-warned row shows nothing |
| T13 | must-surface-mutation-error | `error="Save failed"` | Red error line renders under the toolbar; absent when `error` unset |
| T14 | must-collapse-list-header-when-collapsed | `listHeader` set, rail collapsed | `listHeader` hidden while collapsed, shown while expanded |

## Edge Cases

- Nothing selected (`selectedId === null`): the pane shows `EmptyState`, Cancel and
  Save are disabled, and Delete defaults to disabled (nothing to delete).
- New/unsaved draft: the consumer passes `canDelete={false}` so Delete is not
  offered for a row that isn't persisted yet, even though a draft is being edited.
- Empty record list: the rail shows `emptyList` (falling back to "Nothing here
  yet." when omitted).
- `busy` (saving) in flight: Save renders "Saving…" and Delete is disabled so a
  record can't be deleted mid-save.
- A row without `warn` renders no trailing accessory; a row with `warn` but no
  `warnCount` renders a bare `⚠` rather than a count badge.
- Rows whose labels are long identifiers (URLs): widen the rail via `railWidth`.
- The rail is always collapsible (a core `TopicDetail` behavior); collapsing hides
  the `listHeader` and each row's warn badge/label, leaving the icon strip.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: A master/detail editor starts with NavigationSplitView (iPad/macOS) or NavigationStack with conditional .sheet (iPhone). Toolbar uses .toolbar with .principal placement for the title; action buttons (New, Delete, Cancel, Save) go in .confirmationDialog or direct .toolbar placement with .destructive styling for Delete. Records list is a List with selection binding (state-driven). Detail pane conditionally renders the form (editing) or EmptyState (nothing selected). Warn badges use .badge modifier on List items or overlay FontIcon views; count badges use Badge(count).

- **Compose**: Root is a Column containing a Row for toolbar (Material3 TopAppBar or custom Row with Material3 Button), optional error Text (red foreground, small padding), and a horizontal Row splitting records LazyColumn and detail pane. Selection state (selectedId) drives List selection and pane visibility. Warn badges render inline in ListItem trailing slot as Badge composables or overlay Icons with warning color. State flows downward as MutableState props; mutations flow upward via callbacks.

- **React/Web (TypeScript)**: Block at `packages/web/packages/ui/src/blocks/editor-section.tsx`, exported via `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks`. Assembles `ButtonBar` (toolbar), `TopicDetail` (records rail + detail pane), `EmptyState`, and `Badge` from `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/components`. Responsive collapsing (rail to icon strip) and mobile toolbar wrapping (375/768/1440px) are inherited from TopicDetail and ButtonBar; verify with Playwright in ui-showcase. Demo at ui-showcase Topic editor-section; regenerate sources.generated.ts via gen-sources.py after source changes.

- **AppKit / UIKit**: Start with NSSplitViewController (macOS) or UISplitViewController (iOS). Toolbar is NSToolbar (macOS) with a title Run and button items, or UIToolbar (iOS) with UIBarButtonItems (New, Delete, Cancel, Save). Records rail is NSTableView/NSOutlineView (macOS) or UITableViewController (iOS) with selection bindings driving pane visibility. Detail pane is a conditional container: editing state shows the form, nothing-selected state shows EmptyState. Warn badges are overlay NSImageView/UIImageView icons (⚠ glyph) or cell background tints. All state and callbacks flow through the view controller.

- **WinUI 3**: Root Grid with RowDefinitions for toolbar (~44px), optional error line (~24px), and content area (RowHeight=*). CommandBar holds title (TextBlock/Run in StackPanel, left-aligned, Foreground="{StaticResource GoldToken}") and Button commands (New, Delete, Cancel, Save) right-aligned with Binding to CanExecute and Click event handlers; button enabled states reflect editing, dirty, and busy conditions. Error TextBlock (Margin="12,0,12,0", Foreground="{StaticResource RedToken}") renders only when error property is set. Content area is a Grid with two ColumnDefinitions (ColumnWidth=240 for rail, ColumnWidth=* for pane): ListView for records (SelectionMode.Single, SelectedItem="{x:Bind SelectedId, Mode=TwoWay}", ItemsSource="{x:Bind Items}") and ContentPresenter for detail pane (Content="{x:Bind editing ? form : emptyState}"). Warn badges are FontIcon overlays (Unicode ⚠, Foreground="{StaticResource WarningToken}") or Badge controls in the ListViewItem.Template. All elements use Stretch sizing with explicit Heights/Margins for layout stability; apply Reveal hover effects on ListView items and toolbar buttons.

API (`@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks/editor-section`):

```ts
interface EditorSectionItem {
  id: string
  label: string
  sublabel?: string
  icon?: React.ReactNode      // 16px leading icon (rail fills a neutral ring if omitted)
  warn?: boolean              // shows a ⚠ at the row's right edge
  warnTitle?: string
  warnCount?: number          // when set (and warn), renders a "⚠ N" count badge
}
interface EditorSectionProps {
  title: React.ReactNode
  titleBadge?: React.ReactNode
  createLabel: string
  items: EditorSectionItem[]
  selectedId: string | null
  onSelect: (id: string) => void
  onNew: () => void
  onDelete?: () => void        // omit → no Delete button
  onCancel: () => void
  onSave: () => void
  dirty: boolean
  busy?: boolean               // default false
  canDelete?: boolean          // default: "anything selected"
  error?: React.ReactNode      // red line under the toolbar
  emptyList?: React.ReactNode  // rail empty label; default "Nothing here yet."
  emptyDetail: React.ReactNode // EmptyState title when nothing selected
  listHeader?: React.ReactNode // rail leading slot; hidden while collapsed
  railWidth?: number           // widen for long-identifier rails
  children: React.ReactNode    // the record editor form, shown while editing
  className?: string
}
export function EditorSection(props: EditorSectionProps): React.ReactElement
```

Accessibility: the toolbar is `role="toolbar"` (via `ButtonBar`) with labeled
buttons whose `disabled` reflects the editing/dirty/busy state; each warn badge
carries `warnTitle` as its title/aria-label; the rail's selection and collapse
behaviors come from `TopicDetail`.

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: `EditorSection` is a pure assembly with no visual grammar of its
  own. **Rationale**: Every editor topic must look identical; delegating all
  appearance to `ButtonBar` + `TopicDetail` + `EmptyState` keeps one blessed home
  for each part and avoids drift (optimize-for-change).
- **Decision**: The consumer owns all state (list, selection, draft, dirty, busy,
  error) and callbacks. **Rationale**: The shell computes only derived enablement;
  keeping the source of truth outside makes it reusable across every record type.
- **Decision**: "Editing" is derived from `selectedId !== null`, and Save from
  `editing && dirty`. **Rationale**: One selection prop drives both the pane
  choice and the toolbar enablement, so callers can't put the two out of sync.
- **Decision**: `canDelete` defaults to "anything selected" but honors an explicit
  `false`. **Rationale**: The common case needs no wiring, while a new/unsaved
  draft can suppress a Delete that would target a non-row.
- **Decision**: Warn rendering is data-driven from `warn`/`warnCount`/`warnTitle`
  on each item, mapping to a `Badge` or a bare `⚠`. **Rationale**: The rail stays a
  generic `TopicDetail`; the "needs configuration" affordance is expressed as data,
  not a new rail feature.
