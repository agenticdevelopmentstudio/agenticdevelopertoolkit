# Alert & Dialog System

## Overview

The canonical styled alert / confirm / modal-dialog treatment for ADH. It is
realized by evolving `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui`'s existing `AlertModal`
(`packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/alert-modal.tsx`) **backward-compatibly** —
current call-sites (`LoginCard`, `ProviderLinkHandler`, `SsoCallback`, admin
`authentication/page.tsx`, tests) keep working. Larger modal dialogs (e.g. the hub
invitation modal) reuse the same header + footer-button system on top of the base
`Dialog`.

It is one controlled component for two common shapes — **Alert** (single action,
full-width gold `[ OK ]`) and **Confirm** (two actions `[ Cancel ][ OK ]`, equal
width, OK gold) — plus a **destructive** mode (red action, no keyboard shortcuts)
and a caller-configurable keyboard policy. The same header style and footer-button
rules are exposed for composed dialogs so everything looks uniform.

## Ingredients

| Name | Domain | Role | Required | Configuration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dialog | agenticdevelopertoolkit://recipes/dialog | Base overlay / focus-trap / portal that the system is built on | yes | reused unchanged |
| Button | agenticdevelopertoolkit://recipes/button | Footer action + cancel buttons | yes | `variant="default"` (gold action), `variant="ghost"`/`outline` (cancel), red for destructive |

## Integration Requirements

- **full-width-single-action**: With one button, the action button MUST be full width of the content area and gold (`Button variant="default"`).
- **equal-width-when-narrow**: With two buttons and content width `≤ 2 × Wmax`, the row MUST split into two equal-width (`flex-1`) buttons `[ Cancel ][ OK ]`, Cancel `ghost`/`outline` and OK gold.
- **natural-width-when-wide**: With two buttons and content width `> 2 × Wmax`, the buttons MUST keep natural width and right-justify (`justify-end`), Cancel then OK.
- **order-cancel-then-action**: The order MUST always be Cancel (left) then the action (right).
- **keyboard-default**: Under `keyboard:"default"`, Escape MUST dismiss via cancel if a cancel button exists (else via the single action), and Enter MUST activate the action.
- **keyboard-none**: Under `keyboard:"none"`, the modal MUST honor no keyboard shortcuts and be dismissable only by clicking a button (or the close affordance if shown).
- **keyboard-explicit-map**: Under an explicit key→action map, only listed keys MUST act, mapped to the named button; a key mapped to a button that is not present MUST be ignored.
- **destructive-forces-none**: When `destructive` is true, the action button MUST render red (`apt-red`) and the keyboard policy MUST be forced to `"none"` regardless of `keyboard`.
- **block-dismissal-when-busy**: When `busy` is true, the component MUST block dismissal and replace the buttons with a spinner.
- **be-accessible-dialog**: The surface MUST be `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal`, labelled by the title and described by the body; initial focus MUST be the action button under `"default"` (the first field for composed form dialogs); focus MUST be trapped while open and restored to the opener on close.

## Layout

Single-button alert (button spans the content width):

```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│  Title (apt-gold)                  │   ← highlight-color header
│  Body copy, proportional padding.  │
│  [               OK              ] │   ← full-width gold
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

Two-button confirm (equal width):

```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│  Title (apt-gold)                  │
│  Body copy.                        │
│  [    Cancel    ][      OK       ] │   ← equal width; OK = gold
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

Wide dialog (content wider than 2× the max button width → buttons keep natural width and right-justify):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Title (apt-gold)                                         │
│  … wider content …                                       │
│                              [  Cancel  ][     OK      ]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Header**: title in the highlight color (`apt-gold`), `font-semibold`. An optional `tone` icon (info/success/error) sits to the left of the title.
- **Size**: width is proportional to content with a sensible default cap (`max-w-md` for alerts; composed dialogs may set their own). Height hugs content.
- **Padding**: consistent interior padding from `--space-*` (≈ `p-6`); footer separated by a `--space` gap; no ad-hoc values.
- **Tokens**: header `apt-gold`; body `apt-text` / `apt-text-muted`; surface `apt-surface`; border `apt-border`. Action gold (`variant="default"`) normally, red (`apt-red`) when destructive; Cancel `ghost`/`outline`. Built on the existing `Dialog` (Base UI). No raw hex; no `!important`.

## Shared State

| State | Source | Consumer | Direction | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| open | Caller | Dialog | Down | Prop |
| busy | Caller | Footer buttons / dismissal guard | Down | Prop; replaces buttons with a spinner |
| keyboard policy | Caller (`keyboard`, `destructive`) | Key handler | Down | Prop; `destructive` forces `"none"` |
| confirm / cancel intent | Key handler + buttons | Caller (`onConfirm` / `onCancel`) | Up | Callbacks |

## Integration Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | full-width-single-action | one-button alert | action button full width, gold |
| T2 | equal-width-when-narrow | two buttons, narrow content | equal-width `[ Cancel ][ OK ]` |
| T3 | natural-width-when-wide | two buttons, wide content | natural-width, right-justified |
| T4 | keyboard-default | `keyboard:"default"`, Enter then Escape | Enter→confirm; Escape→cancel (or OK if no cancel) |
| T5 | keyboard-none | `keyboard:"none"`, press keys | keys ignored |
| T6 | keyboard-explicit-map | `{ Enter: "confirm" }` | only Enter acts → confirm; unlisted keys ignored |
| T7 | destructive-forces-none | `destructive: true` | action red; no keyboard shortcuts |
| T8 | block-dismissal-when-busy | `busy: true` | dismissal blocked; spinner replaces buttons |

## Edge Cases

- The equal-width vs right-justified choice is governed by the `content width ≤ 2 × Wmax` threshold, where `Wmax` is the larger natural button width.
- A key mapped to a button that is not rendered is ignored.
- `destructive` overrides any supplied `keyboard` value (forced `"none"`) so a delete is always an explicit click.
- `busy` blocks all dismissal paths and hides the buttons behind a spinner.

## Platform Notes

- **React / Web (TypeScript):** Evolve `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/alert-modal.tsx`; reuse `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/dialog.tsx` (Base UI) unchanged. Extend (not replace) `packages/web/packages/ui/src/__tests__/alertModal.test.tsx`. Demo in the UI showcase app (a consumer of this package, outside this repo). Reused by the hub `InvitationModal` (header + footer-button system).
- **Responsive:** Verify via Playwright (ui-showcase) — each variant rendered, keyboard flows exercised, at 375 / 768 / 1440.
- **SwiftUI / Compose:** Not applicable — web-only shared system.

API. Existing props (kept): `open`, `title`, `description`, `tone` (`"info" | "success" | "error"`), `confirmLabel` (default `"OK"`), `confirmVariant`, `onConfirm`, `cancelLabel` (presence ⇒ confirm mode), `onCancel`, `busy`. New props:

```ts
type KeyAction = "confirm" | "cancel";

interface AlertModalKeyboardAdds {
  /** "default" (see keyboard rules) | "none" (no shortcuts) | explicit key→action map. */
  keyboard?: "default" | "none" | Partial<Record<string, KeyAction>>;
  /** Destructive: action button red (apt-red); forces keyboard "none". */
  destructive?: boolean;
}
```

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: Evolve the existing `AlertModal` backward-compatibly rather than introduce a new component. **Rationale**: Defaults preserve today's behavior (`keyboard:"default"`, `destructive:false`); existing call-sites that pass only `tone`/`confirmLabel`/`cancelLabel`/`onConfirm`/`onCancel` are unaffected in API while gaining the standardized header + button layout. Smoke-check each known call-site during implementation — `LoginCard`, `ProviderLinkHandler`, `SsoCallback`, and admin `authentication/page.tsx` — so the visual/keyboard change is intended, not a regression.
- **Decision**: Destructive mode forces no keyboard shortcuts. **Rationale**: A destructive action must be a deliberate, explicit click — never Enter-to-confirm.
- **Decision**: The header + footer-button system is exposed for composed dialogs. **Rationale**: Larger dialogs (e.g. the invitation modal) stay visually uniform with alerts/confirms.

## Compliance

| [unit-test-coverage](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/best-practices#unit-test-coverage) | partial | Best Practices |

`separation-of-concerns` is passed: `AlertModal` composes two independently-recipe'd ingredients — `Dialog` for the overlay/focus-trap/portal and `Button` for footer actions — rather than reimplementing either. `unit-test-coverage` is partial: `alertModal.test.tsx` exercises the default/none keyboard policies, `destructive`, `busy`, all three button-layout modes, tone, and the closed state, but the `keyboard-explicit-map` behavior (an arbitrary key→action map) has no dedicated test even though it is implemented in `alert-modal.tsx`'s `keyMap`. `screen-reader-support` and `focus-management` are passed: the surface is built on Base UI's `Dialog` primitive, which supplies the role, `aria-modal`, labelling, focus-trap, and restore-to-opener machinery `be-accessible-dialog` requires. `keyboard-navigable` is passed: Enter/Escape/explicit-map handling plus the footer buttons' native Tab-then-activate semantics remain available even under `keyboard:"none"`, where only the custom shortcuts are disabled. `touch-target-size` is failed: `Button`'s fixed size-variant heights (`h-6`=24px etc.) sit below the 44×44pt/48×48dp minimum by design, reachable only through an ancestor-set `--adh-button-min-height`/`--adh-button-min-width`, and this recipe never sets either variable on its footer buttons. `contrast-ratio` is partial: the header/body/surface/border tokens (`apt-gold`, `apt-text`, `apt-surface`, `apt-border`) are used consistently in place of raw hex, but their actual rendered contrast is a property of the shared theme file this recipe's own source cannot confirm. `no-hardcoded-strings` is partial: `title`, `description`, and both button labels are caller-supplied props, but `confirmLabel`'s default value `"OK"` is a hardcoded English literal baked into `alert-modal.tsx` rather than sourced from a localization resource.
