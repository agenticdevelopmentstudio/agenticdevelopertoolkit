# Menu Button

## Overview

A button that displays and toggles between a hamburger menu icon (three stacked bars) and a close icon (two bars crossed). The icon state is controlled by a prop; the bars are rendered as plain DOM elements rather than SVG, allowing them to animate and inherit the button's text color. The component requires an accessible name and extends standard HTML button attributes. See `MenuButton.tsx` for the component and `css/base.css` for the geometry and hit-area values behind the specifics below.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **button-element**: Component MUST render as an HTML `<button>` element with `type="button"`.
- **accessible-label**: Component MUST accept a required `label` prop that is used as the button's accessible name via `aria-label`.
- **menu-icon-default**: Component MUST display three bars (hamburger icon) when no `icon` prop is provided or when `icon="menu"`.
- **close-icon-variant**: Component MUST display two bars crossed (close icon) when `icon="close"`.
- **button-attribute-passthrough**: Component MUST pass through all standard `HTMLButtonElement` attributes (e.g., `disabled`, `onClick`, `className`, `data-*` attributes).
- **menu-button-class**: Component MUST apply the CSS class `menu-button` to the button element.
- **close-variant-class**: Component MUST apply the CSS class `menu-button--close` to the button element when `icon="close"`.
- **custom-classname**: Component MUST allow custom CSS classes to be added via a `className` prop and combine them with the component's internal classes.
- **plain-element-bars**: Component MUST render bars as plain `<span>` elements with class `mb-bar` rather than as an SVG, to enable animation and color inheritance.
- **relative-positioning**: The button MUST be `position: relative` so the 44×44px `::after` hit-area pseudo-element centers on it correctly (`css/base.css`).

## Appearance

- **Bar rendering**: Bars are plain HTML elements (`<span>`) with class `mb-bar`, not SVG.
- **Bar quantity**: Three bars in menu state, two bars in close state.
- **Bar dimensions**: Each bar MUST be 16px wide (`--menu-bar-width`) and 3px thick (`--menu-bar-thickness`), with fully rounded ends (`border-radius: 999px`). Bars MUST be spaced with a 3px gap (`--menu-bar-gap`), giving a 6px pitch (thickness + gap); thickness, gap, and pitch MUST all be whole-number CSS pixels so every bar rounds to the same device-pixel thickness regardless of device-pixel ratio or the button's fractional position (`css/base.css`). The icon occupies a 32×32px box (`--menu-size`).
- **Bar colour**: Bars MUST use `background: currentColor`, taking the button's `color` so a consumer themes the icon by setting `color` on the button.
- **Bar transition**: Bars MUST apply `transition: 0.25s` (all properties), which animates the `rotate()` transform applied to the first and last bar when toggling to the close state; see **reduced-motion** in Compliance below.
- **Close icon derivation**: In close state, the close icon (X shape) is derived from the two bars via CSS rotation/transform; the component does not render separate markup for the X.
- **Background**: No background specified in component; inherits from button styling context.
- **Border**: No border specified in component; inherits from button styling context.
- **Shadow**: No shadow specified in component; inherits from button styling context.

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|-------|------------------|
| Default (menu) | Three stacked bars |
| Close | Two bars crossed (via CSS transform) |
| Disabled | Standard HTML button disabled styling (subject to CSS) |
| Focused | Standard HTML button focus styling (subject to CSS) |
| Pressed/Active | Standard HTML button active styling (subject to CSS) |

## Accessibility

- **Role**: Button (implicit from `<button>` element).
- **Accessible name**: MUST be provided via the required `label` prop, which is applied as `aria-label`. The button has no visible text, so an accessible name is required.
- **Icon symbol**: Hamburger menu and close icons are purely visual; the accessible name provided by `label` replaces them functionally (e.g., "Menu" or "Close menu").
- **Keyboard navigation**: Button is fully keyboard accessible via standard `<button>` element behavior; may be activated via Space or Enter keys.
- **Assistive technology**: Screen readers will announce the button's accessible name and role.
- **Toggle state (consumer-managed)**: The component itself tracks no open/closed state. When used to toggle a menu, the composing screen SHOULD pass `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` (referencing the menu it opens) through the button's pass-through props, and SHOULD update `label` to match the current state (e.g. "Open menu" / "Close menu").
- **Minimum tap target**: The button's visible icon box is 32×32px (`--menu-size`), but the button exposes a 44×44px hit area via an absolutely positioned `::after` pseudo-element (`--menu-hit: 44px`), centred on the button because `.menu-button` is `position: relative` (`css/base.css`; see **relative-positioning**). This meets the 44×44pt minimum tap target guideline.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| menu-button-001 | button-element | Render with default props | Button element with `type="button"` is rendered |
| menu-button-002 | accessible-label | `label="Menu"` | `aria-label="Menu"` is present on button element |
| menu-button-003 | menu-icon-default | No `icon` prop | Three `<span class="mb-bar">` elements render |
| menu-button-004 | close-icon-variant | `icon="close"` | Two `<span class="mb-bar">` elements render |
| menu-button-005 | menu-button-class | Default render | Button has class `menu-button` |
| menu-button-006 | close-variant-class | `icon="close"` | Button has classes `menu-button` and `menu-button--close` |
| menu-button-007 | custom-classname | `className="custom-class"` | Button includes `custom-class` in its class list |
| menu-button-008 | button-attribute-passthrough | `onClick={handler}` | Handler is invoked on button click |
| menu-button-009 | button-attribute-passthrough | `disabled={true}`, then simulate a click | Button has the `disabled` attribute; the `onClick` handler is not invoked |
| menu-button-010 | menu-icon-default, close-icon-variant | Toggle `icon` prop from `'menu'` to `'close'` | Bar count changes from three to two; `menu-button--close` class is added |
| menu-button-011 | plain-element-bars | Render with default props | Each `.mb-bar` element's tag name is `SPAN`; no `<svg>` element is present |
| menu-button-012 | menu-icon-default | `icon="menu"` (explicit) | Three `<span class="mb-bar">` elements render, same as the default |
| menu-button-013 | menu-icon-default | `icon="hamburger"` (value outside the type) | Three `<span class="mb-bar">` elements render; falls back to the menu icon because only `icon === 'close'` is checked |
| menu-button-014 | custom-classname | No `className` prop | Button's `class` attribute is exactly `menu-button` with no extra whitespace or empty tokens |
| menu-button-015 | relative-positioning | Default render | `.menu-button` computed `position` is `relative`; the `::after` element's computed size is 44×44px |
| menu-button-016 | accessible-label | `label` prop omitted (bypassing the type system) | No `aria-label` attribute is present on the button |
| menu-button-017 | accessible-label | `label=""` | `aria-label=""` is present; the button has an empty accessible name |
| menu-button-018 | custom-classname, close-variant-class | `icon="close" className="custom-class"` | Button's `class` attribute is `menu-button menu-button--close custom-class` |

## Edge Cases

- **No label prop**: `label` is a required, non-optional `string` prop with no default, so omitting it is a TypeScript compile-time error; the component performs no runtime check. A caller outside TypeScript's reach that omits it renders a button with `aria-label={undefined}` — a button with no accessible name.
- **Icon prop invalid value**: Component expects `icon` to be `'menu'` or `'close'`. Providing any other value (e.g., `icon="hamburger"`) will render with the default menu icon since the close state is checked explicitly (see menu-button-013).
- **Empty string label**: An empty `label=""` satisfies the type requirement but results in an inaccessible button with no meaningful name. The component accepts this but the caller SHOULD provide a meaningful label.
- **Disabled state interaction**: When disabled, the button MUST NOT respond to clicks; this is standard HTML button behavior and does not depend on component logic.
- **Multiple class combinations**: Component combines `menu-button`, the conditional `menu-button--close`, and any custom `className` prop. Classes are filtered and joined with spaces; empty strings are removed (see menu-button-014 and menu-button-018).

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `icon` | `'menu' \| 'close'` | `'menu'` | Controls which icon is displayed: `'menu'` for three bars or `'close'` for two bars |
| `label` | `string` | (required) | Accessible name for the button; used as `aria-label` |
| `className` | `string` | (optional) | Custom CSS class(es) to add to the button element |
| `...rest` | `HTMLButtonElement` attributes | N/A | All standard button attributes (e.g., `disabled`, `onClick`, `data-*`) are passed through |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: This is a UI control with no deep-linking semantics. Deep linking is handled by the page or component that contains the menu button.

## Localization

Not applicable: The component accepts the `label` string from the caller, so localization is the responsibility of the consuming application. The component itself contains no user-facing strings and performs no locale-sensitive transforms.

## Accessibility Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Reduce Motion | Not supported: `css/base.css` defines no `prefers-reduced-motion` override, so the `0.25s` bar transition runs at full speed regardless of the setting. |
| Increase Contrast | Not supported: `css/base.css` defines no `prefers-contrast` override; bar color is fixed to `currentColor`. |
| Differentiate Without Color | Not applicable: The icon is purely visual and the accessible name is always provided via `aria-label`. |

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: Component contains no feature flag logic.

## Analytics

Not applicable: Component emits no analytics events. Analytics instrumentation is the responsibility of the consuming application via `onClick` or other event handlers.

## Privacy

Not applicable: Component stores and transmits no personal data. The `label` string is provided by the caller and is a UI string only.

## Logging

Not applicable: Component performs no logging.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web**: Implemented in React as a functional component (`MenuButton.tsx`). Bars are `<span>` elements with class `mb-bar`; the close icon is derived from the bars via CSS transform (rotation). Styling is external to the component and defined in `css/base.css`, including the `position: relative` and 44×44px `::after` hit area. The component accepts all standard `HTMLButtonElement` attributes via prop spread.
- **SwiftUI**: Prefer the system glyphs first: `Image(systemName: "line.3.horizontal")` for the menu state and `Image(systemName: "xmark")` for the close state, both taking the button's color via `.foregroundStyle` (`.foregroundColor` is deprecated). Reserve a custom bar-based rendering — three `Capsule().frame(width: 16, height: 3)` shapes, two rotated for the close state — for cases that need the animated bar-to-X morph the source implements. Respect `@Environment(\.isEnabled)` for disabled state, and give the tap target a minimum 44×44pt frame independent of the icon's own size.
- **Compose**: Implement as `IconButton { Column { Box(Modifier.size(16.dp, 3.dp).background(LocalContentColor.current, CircleShape)) … } }`, applying `Modifier.graphicsLayer { rotationZ = ... }` to the first and last bar for the close state. Use `LocalContentColor` to inherit the button's color. Respect Compose's `enabled` state, and size the `IconButton`'s minimum touch target to 48dp.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: Prefer the system glyphs first: `UIImage(systemName: "line.3.horizontal")` (UIKit) / `NSImage(systemSymbolName: "line.3.horizontal", accessibilityDescription:)` (AppKit) for menu, and `"xmark"` for close, tinted via `tintColor`. Reserve a custom view with three `UIView`/`NSView` bars and `CABasicAnimation` rotation for the animated morph. Handle `isEnabled` and `isHighlighted` states, accept the label for `accessibilityLabel`, and give the control a minimum 44×44pt hit area (e.g. by enlarging the tappable frame beyond the visible icon, as `css/base.css`'s `::after` does).
- **WinUI 3**: Prefer the system glyphs first: a `FontIcon` using the Segoe Fluent Icons `GlobalNavigationButton` glyph for the menu state and `Cancel` for the close state, with `Foreground` inheriting the button's text color. Reserve a custom `StackPanel` of `Rectangle` bars with `RotateTransform` for the animated morph. Set `AutomationProperties.Name` for accessibility, respect `IsEnabled`, and ensure the `Button`'s minimum interactive size meets the platform's 44×44 effective pixel guidance.

## Design Decisions

1. **Decision**: Render the bars as plain `<span>` elements rather than SVG.
   **Rationale**: `<span>` elements enable pixel-perfect alignment, color inheritance from the button's text color, and simpler animation via CSS transforms. SVG would require additional coordinate transformation logic and would not automatically inherit the button's color.
   **Approved**: pending

2. **Decision**: Derive the close icon from the two bars via CSS rotation rather than rendering separate markup for the X.
   **Rationale**: Rotating the existing bars keeps the component's JSX simpler and ensures that any change to bar geometry (thickness, spacing) automatically updates both the menu and close icons consistently.
   **Approved**: pending

3. **Decision**: Render bars conditionally — three in menu state, two in close state — rather than always rendering three and hiding one with CSS.
   **Rationale**: This is simpler than rendering three bars in both states and using CSS to hide one, and it matches the semantic difference between the two icons.
   **Approved**: pending

4. **Decision**: Keep all animation logic in CSS; the component renders static markup only.
   **Rationale**: This keeps the component lightweight and makes animations easy to customize or disable, e.g. for `prefers-reduced-motion` — which `css/base.css` does not currently implement (see **reduced-motion** in Compliance).
   **Approved**: pending

5. **Decision**: Require the `label` prop with no default value.
   **Rationale**: The button has no visible text, so an accessible name is necessary for the component to be usable by assistive technologies.
   **Approved**: pending

Statuses rest on `MenuButton.tsx` (the required `label` prop rendered as `aria-label` on a native `<button>`, with no custom ARIA roles needed) and `css/base.css` (`position: relative` plus the 44px `::after` hit area satisfy touch-target-size; the absence of any `prefers-reduced-motion` rule fails reduced-motion).
