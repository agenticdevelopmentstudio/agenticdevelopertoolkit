# Stats

## Overview

Stats renders a three-column grid of statistics pairs—each a number or metric (`term`) paired with its explanation or label (`detail`). At viewport widths of 34rem (≈544px) and above, entries lay out three per row and a fourth entry wraps onto a new row; below 34rem — for example at 375px — the grid collapses to a single column and entries stack one per row. The component is designed for quick visual scanning across multiple statistics without interaction. It uses semantic HTML (`dl`, `dt`, `dd`) to encode the relationship between statistic and caption, making it accessible and SEO-friendly. Use it to display side-by-side key metrics, counts, or comparable measurements.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-entries**: Component MUST render one entry for each item in the `entries` array.
- **wrap-each-entry**: Component MUST wrap each entry in its own `div` container (the wrapper div, not the `dl`, is the grid item).
- **render-term-and-detail**: Component MUST render the `term` and `detail` of each entry as `dt` and `dd` elements respectively within the entry wrapper.
- **preserve-node-content**: Component MUST accept and render `term` and `detail` as `ReactNode`, preserving inline elements, text, and component structures passed by the caller.
- **use-semantic-markup**: Component MUST wrap all entries in a `dl` (description list) element to encode the statistical relationship.
- **maintain-order**: Component MUST render entries in the order they appear in the `entries` array.

## Appearance

- **Layout**: Explicit three-column grid (`grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))`) at viewport widths ≥34rem; a fourth entry wraps onto a new row rather than forcing a fourth column. Below 34rem the grid collapses to `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr)` and entries stack one per row. The column count is declared explicitly rather than derived from an `auto-fit`/`auto-fill` floor — see Design Decisions. Defined in `packages/web/packages/landing/src/css/blocks.css`.
- **Container**: `dl` with class `lp-stats`.
- **Grid item**: Each entry is wrapped in its own `div`. That wrapper carries no class of its own — the `lp-stats` class lives on the `dl`, and the wrapper is styled only through the `.lp-stats div` descendant selector in `packages/web/packages/landing/src/css/blocks.css`.
- **Term (`dt`)**: No specific padding, font, or color defined in component; defer to CSS rules via `lp-stats` class.
- **Detail (`dd`)**: No specific padding, font, or color defined in component; defer to CSS rules via `lp-stats` class.

## States

Not applicable: Stats is a static, non-interactive component. It has no pressed, disabled, focused, loading, or hover states.

## Accessibility

- **Semantic structure**: The `dl`/`dt`/`dd` markup encodes a description-list relationship: each entry's `dt` holds the statistic's value (the `term`) and its `dd` holds the caption that explains it (the `detail`). Screen-reader support for the `dl`/`dt`/`dd` pattern is inconsistent across assistive technology, so this markup is a progressive enhancement rather than a guarantee that the relationship will be announced.
- **Label requirement**: No separate `aria-label` is added by the component. Each entry pairs the value (`dt`) with its caption (`dd`) in a single wrapper `div`, which conveys the relationship visually regardless of how a given screen reader handles `dl`/`dt`/`dd`.
- **Minimum tap/click target**: Inline text links within `term` or `detail` are exempt from touch-target minimums. If interactive elements (buttons, links) are added to the term or detail content by the caller, those elements SHOULD each have a minimum touch target of 44×44pt (per agenticdevelopercookbook://guidelines/implementing/ui/touch-click-targets).

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|-------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| stats-001 | render-entries, wrap-each-entry | `entries: [{term: "10", detail: "Users"}]` | Component renders one entry as a `div` child of the `dl` |
| stats-002 | render-entries | `entries: [{...}, {...}, {...}]` (3 items) | Component renders three entry wrapper divs |
| stats-003 | render-term-and-detail | `entries: [{term: "42", detail: "Days"}]` | Rendered as `<dt>42</dt><dd>Days</dd>` within the entry div |
| stats-004 | preserve-node-content | `entries: [{term: <strong>99</strong>, detail: "Active"}]` | Strong element is preserved and rendered within the `dt` |
| stats-005 | preserve-node-content | `entries: [{term: "10", detail: <em>Total Users</em>}]` | Em element is preserved and rendered within the `dd` |
| stats-006 | use-semantic-markup | Any valid entries array | Top-level element is `dl` with class `lp-stats` |
| stats-007 | maintain-order | `entries: [{term: "A", detail: "First"}, {term: "B", detail: "Second"}]` | First entry renders before second entry in DOM order |
| stats-008 | render-entries | `entries: []` | Component renders an empty `dl` with class `lp-stats` and no child `div`s |
| stats-009 | preserve-node-content | `entries: [{term: null, detail: "Users"}]` | Component renders an empty `dt` within the entry `div`; `dd` renders normally |

## Edge Cases

- **Empty entries array**: If `entries` is an empty array, the component MUST render an empty `dl` with class `lp-stats` and no child divs (stats-008).
- **Single entry**: If `entries` contains only one item, the component MUST render that entry in a single wrapper div. At viewport widths ≥34rem the three-column grid places it in the first column, leaving the remaining two columns of that row empty.
- **Null or undefined ReactNode content**: If `term` or `detail` is `null` or `undefined`, the component MUST render the corresponding `dt` or `dd` as an empty element (stats-009). The component does not skip or substitute placeholder content for a null/undefined entry: `entries` is rendered positionally and unconditionally, so silently dropping an item would break the one-to-one correspondence between the `entries` array and the rendered list. Callers that want to omit a statistic MUST filter it out of `entries` before passing it to the component, rather than passing `null`/`undefined` `term`/`detail`.
- **Large content in term or detail**: If the `term` or `detail` contains very long text or large inline components, layout may wrap or overflow according to CSS rules; the component itself places no constraint on content size.
- **React Fragments or multiple children**: If the caller passes a React Fragment or array as the `term` or `detail`, the Fragment/array is rendered as-is within the `dt` or `dd`. React handles this transparently.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|--------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `entries` | `StatEntry[]` | — | Yes | Array of `{term: ReactNode, detail: ReactNode}` objects to display. |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: Stats is a display-only component without its own route or deep-link semantics. Any deep linking is handled by the consuming page or application.

## Localization

The grid mirrors automatically in right-to-left layouts: `packages/web/packages/landing/src/css/blocks.css` declares `grid-template-columns` with no explicit `direction` or column-order override, so the columns follow the document's writing direction under `dir="rtl"`. Stats accepts `term` and `detail` as `ReactNode`, giving the caller full control over localized content; the component renders whatever is passed and applies no formatting of its own. Callers MUST format numbers (and any other locale-sensitive values) for the user's locale before passing them as `term`/`detail` — an invariant/culture-insensitive formatter would render the wrong digit grouping, decimal separator, or numeral system for the viewer's locale.

## Accessibility Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Reduce Motion | Not applicable: Stats is static and contains no animations. |
| Increase Contrast | Not applicable: The component has no built-in color values; contrast is governed by CSS rules applied via the `lp-stats` class and the caller's styling. |
| Differentiate Without Color | Not applicable: Stats uses semantic HTML and does not rely on color alone to convey meaning. The `dt`/`dd` structure encodes the relationship independent of color. |

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: Stats contains no conditional features or toggles. All functionality is always active.

## Analytics

Not applicable: Stats is a static display component and does not emit user-interaction events. Any analytics tracking is the responsibility of the consumer context or parent component.

## Privacy

Not applicable: Stats does not collect, store, or transmit user data. It simply renders content passed to it.

## Logging

Not applicable: Stats does not emit logs. Errors in rendering (e.g., invalid React children) are reported by React's own dev-mode warnings, not by the component.

## Platform Notes

- **TypeScript/Web (React)**: See `packages/web/packages/landing/src/blocks/Stats.tsx`. The component returns a `dl` with class `lp-stats` containing entry wrapper `div`s (no class of their own), each with a `dt` (term) and `dd` (detail). Styling and the three-column grid are defined in `packages/web/packages/landing/src/css/blocks.css`; the column count is declared explicitly rather than derived from an `auto-fit`/`auto-fill` floor (see Design Decisions).
- **SwiftUI**: Use `Grid` or `LazyVGrid` with three columns (for example three `GridItem(.flexible())` tracks) rather than `HStack`, so a fourth entry wraps onto a new row instead of forcing a fourth column. Each statistic is a `VStack` with `Text` for the term (value) and a smaller secondary `Text` for the detail (label). Group each pair into one accessibility element with `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` so assistive technology announces the value and its caption together. No semantic equivalent to `dl`/`dt`/`dd` exists in SwiftUI; label each statistic via proximity, visual hierarchy, and the combined accessibility element.
- **Compose**: Use `LazyVerticalGrid(columns = GridCells.Fixed(3))`, or `FlowRow` with `maxItemsInEachRow = 3`, rather than a plain `Row`, so a fourth entry wraps instead of forcing a fourth column. Each statistic is a `Column` containing a `Text` for the term (value, larger) and a `Text` for the detail (label, smaller). Apply `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true)` to each statistic's `Column` so it is announced as one element. Compose has no semantic description-list equivalent; the visual arrangement, size difference, and merged semantics convey the relationship.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: On macOS, use `NSGridView` configured for three columns (or nested `NSStackView`s following the SwiftUI/Compose pattern above), with each statistic's value/caption pair wrapped as one `NSAccessibilityElement` combining the term and detail. On iOS, use `UICollectionView` with a compositional or flow layout fixed to three items per row — not `UIStackView`, which lays every entry in one row that never wraps. Each cell hosts a `UILabel` for the term (larger font, prominent) and a `UILabel` for the detail (smaller font, secondary), wrapped in a single `UIAccessibilityElement` with an `accessibilityLabel` combining term and detail (e.g., "10 users").
- **WinUI 3**: Use a `Grid` with three star-sized columns (`ColumnDefinition Width="*"` × 3), or `ItemsRepeater` with a `UniformGridLayout` (`MaximumRowsOrColumns = 3`), rather than a horizontal `StackPanel`, which never wraps and ignores `Stretch`/`Width="Auto"` when sharing width. Each statistic is a vertical `StackPanel` containing a `TextBlock` for the term (larger `FontSize`, `FontWeight.Bold`) and a `TextBlock` for the detail (smaller `FontSize`, `Opacity=0.7`). Set `AutomationProperties.Name` on each statistic's container (not on the outer `Grid`/`ItemsRepeater`) so assistive technology announces each pair individually.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: Each entry is wrapped in its own `div` rather than placing `dt` and `dd` directly as children of the `dl`.
**Rationale**: This lets the CSS grid layout in `packages/web/packages/landing/src/css/blocks.css` treat each entry pair as a single grid item; the `dl` itself is not the grid container — the wrapper `div`s are the grid items.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: `term` and `detail` accept `ReactNode` rather than being restricted to strings.
**Rationale**: Gives the caller full flexibility to compose rich content (formatted numbers, icons, inline components) without the component prescribing a structure.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The component defines no styling of its own; all visual properties (padding, font, color, layout) are delegated to CSS rules applied via the `lp-stats` class.
**Rationale**: Keeps the component focused on semantic structure; presentation is the responsibility of `packages/web/packages/landing/src/css/blocks.css` and the calling context.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The three-column layout is declared explicitly (`grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))`) rather than derived with an `auto-fit`/`auto-fill` minmax floor.
**Rationale**: Stats lives in the narrow column of a `.lp-split` layout, where a floor wide enough to keep a long caption off four lines only fits two columns, stranding a third entry alone under an empty cell. An explicit three-column count avoids that. A `minmax` floor tuned to produce a specific column count is also arithmetic against a 14px rem that stops holding the moment the base font size changes. See `packages/web/packages/landing/src/css/blocks.css`.
**Approved**: pending
