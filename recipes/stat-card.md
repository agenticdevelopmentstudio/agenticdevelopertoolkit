# StatCard

## Overview

`StatCard` in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui` is the dashboard stat card: an `InfoPanel` headed by
an icon + title with an optional "{tool} ↗" deep link (plus optional extra header
controls via `actions`) in the header actions slot, over a vertical stack of `StatRow` figures, optional freeform content, and a muted
mono footnote. It is **pure assembly** — the shell is `InfoPanel`, the rows are
`StatRow`, the link is `ExternalLink` — so this block owns only the arrangement (a
`gap-2.5` column plus the footnote treatment), not any new chrome.

From a declarative `stats[]` (each `{ label, value, tone }`) it renders one `StatRow`
per entry; `children` render after the rows for the freeform cases (a live error
line, a sparkline), and `footnote` renders last as a small dim mono qualifier (e.g.
"anonymous · cookieless · approximate"). The card is always content-sized — it uses
`InfoPanel`'s default (non-scroll) mode, so it grows to its content rather than
scrolling.

It was extracted from a status site's Traffic/Errors telemetry cards, so every site's
"figure card with a deep link into the source tool" shares one component.

## Ingredients

| Name | Domain | Role | Required | Configuration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| InfoPanel | agenticdevelopercookbook://recipes/info-panel | The card shell — bordered/rounded frame with the standard header (icon + title) and a content-sized body | yes | `title`, `icon`, `actions` (the link + extra `actions`), `className` and remaining host attributes forwarded; default content-sized (no `scroll`) |
| StatRow | agenticdevelopercookbook://recipes/stat | One label/value figure per `stats[]` entry, in the body stack | yes (when `stats[]` non-empty) | `label`, `value`, `tone` passed through from each `StatCardStat` |
| ExternalLink | agenticdevelopercookbook://recipes/external-link | The "{label} ↗" deep link into the source tool, placed in the InfoPanel actions slot | no (only when `link` given) | `href` = `link.href`, children = `link.label`; opens a new tab (noopener) |

The body-stack container, the footnote treatment, and the `stats[]`→rows mapping are
the only things this block owns; `StatCardStat` (`{ label, value, tone }`) is exported
alongside the component.

## Integration Requirements

- **must-render-infopanel-shell**: The card MUST render as an `InfoPanel` whose title is `title` and whose leading glyph is `icon`, exposing the card as a labeled region named by `title`.
- **must-place-link-in-actions**: When `link` is provided, the card MUST render an `ExternalLink` to `link.href` labeled `link.label` in the InfoPanel actions slot, and MUST omit the actions slot when both `link` and `actions` are absent.
- **must-render-actions-after-link**: When `actions` is provided, the card MUST render it in the InfoPanel actions slot, after the deep link when both are present.
- **must-spread-host-attributes**: The card MUST pass remaining host attributes (`data-*`, `id`, handlers) through to the InfoPanel root `<section>`, so hosts can tag the card without a wrapper element.
- **must-render-a-statrow-per-stat**: The card MUST render one `StatRow` per `stats[]` entry, passing that entry's `label`, `value`, and `tone`.
- **must-render-children-after-rows**: The card MUST render `children` after the stat rows, within the same body stack.
- **must-render-footnote-when-present**: The card MUST render `footnote` as a muted mono caption after the children, and MUST omit it when `footnote` is null/undefined.
- **must-stack-body-vertically**: The card MUST arrange the rows, children, and footnote in a single vertical `gap-2.5` column.
- **must-forward-classname**: The card MUST forward `className` onto the InfoPanel outer element.

## Layout

```
┌ InfoPanel  aria-label = title ─────────────────────────────┐
│ [icon] Title                              PostHog ↗         │  header (icon + title; link in actions)
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌ body stack: flex flex-col gap-2.5 ────────────────────┐   │
│ │ PAGEVIEWS · 7D                                637      │   │  ← StatRow (stats[0])
│ │ VISITORS · 7D                                 538      │   │  ← StatRow (stats[1])
│ │ …children (freeform, after the rows)…                 │   │
│ │ anonymous · cookieless · approximate                  │   │  ← footnote (muted mono 10px)
│ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Shell: `InfoPanel` in its default content-sized (non-scroll) mode; `title`, `icon`,
  `className`, and remaining host attributes pass straight through; the InfoPanel
  actions slot receives the `ExternalLink` (when `link` is set) followed by any
  extra `actions`, and is omitted when both are absent.
- Body: a single `<div className="flex flex-col gap-2.5">` holding, in order, the
  mapped `StatRow`s, then `children`, then the footnote.
- Footnote: `pt-0.5 font-mono text-[10px] text-apt-text-dim` — matched to the StatRow
  label's micro-caption grammar; rendered only when `footnote != null`.
- No raw hex, no `!important` — all color/typography via `apt-*` tokens and the
  composed shared parts.

## Shared State

`StatCard` holds no state — it is pure, declarative assembly. Every prop flows down
into a composed part; nothing flows back up except the browser navigation an
`ExternalLink` triggers (a new tab).

| State | Source | Consumer | Direction | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `title` / `icon` / `className` | Caller | InfoPanel | Down | Prop pass-through |
| `link` (`{href,label}`) | Caller | ExternalLink (actions slot) | Down | Prop → `actions` |
| `actions` | Caller | InfoPanel actions slot (after the link) | Down | Prop → `actions` |
| host attributes (`data-*`, `id`) | Caller | InfoPanel root `<section>` | Down | Rest-prop spread |
| `stats[]` | Caller | StatRow (one per entry) | Down | Array `map` |
| `children` | Caller | Body stack (after rows) | Down | Prop |
| `footnote` | Caller | Footnote caption | Down | Prop (rendered when non-null) |
| deep-link navigation | ExternalLink | New browser tab | Up (side effect) | `target="_blank"` anchor |

## Integration Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | must-render-infopanel-shell, must-place-link-in-actions, must-render-a-statrow-per-stat, must-render-footnote-when-present | `<StatCard title="Traffic" link={{href:'https://us.posthog.com',label:'PostHog'}} stats={[{label:'pageviews · 7d',value:'637'},{label:'visitors · 7d',value:'538'}]} footnote="anonymous · cookieless · approximate" />` | region named "Traffic"; a "PostHog ↗" link with `href="https://us.posthog.com"`; rows "pageviews · 7d"/"637" and "visitors · 7d"/"538"; footnote text present |
| T2 | must-render-children-after-rows, must-stack-body-vertically | `<StatCard title="Errors" stats={[{label:'open issues',value:'0'}]}><div>✓ No errors reported</div></StatCard>` | "✓ No errors reported" rendered after the "open issues"/"0" row, inside the one `flex flex-col gap-2.5` body stack |
| T3 | must-place-link-in-actions | `<StatCard title="Errors" stats={[...]} />` (no `link`) | no `ExternalLink`/anchor in the header actions slot |
| T4 | must-render-a-statrow-per-stat | `stats={[{label:'open issues',value:'2',tone:'error'}]}` | value "2" carries the error tone (`text-apt-red`) via StatRow |
| T5 | must-render-footnote-when-present | StatCard with no `footnote` | no footnote caption element rendered |
| T6 | must-render-infopanel-shell | `icon={<Bug/>}` | icon rendered as the decorative leading glyph (`aria-hidden` via InfoPanel) before the title |
| T7 | must-forward-classname | `className="col-span-2"` | InfoPanel outer `<section>` carries `col-span-2` |
| T8 | must-render-actions-after-link, must-place-link-in-actions | `link={{href:'https://g.example',label:'Grafana'}} actions={<span>healthy</span>}` | header actions slot holds the "Grafana ↗" link, then the status word |
| T9 | must-spread-host-attributes | `data-testid="monitor-card" data-monitor="lewis" data-phase="ok"` | outer `<section>` carries all three attributes |

## Edge Cases

- **No `stats`**: `stats?.map(...)` no-ops, so a card with only `children` and/or a
  `footnote` renders fine (`stats` is optional).
- **No `link` and no `actions`**: the InfoPanel actions slot is omitted entirely
  (the header shows just icon + title).
- **`actions` without `link`**: the slot renders just the extra controls (e.g. a
  monitor card's live status word), right-justified by InfoPanel.
- **`footnote` guard is `!= null`**: `null`/`undefined` hide the footnote; an empty
  string (`""`) is *not* null and WOULD render an empty caption — pass `undefined` to
  hide, not `""`.
- **Rows + children + footnote together**: order is always rows → children → footnote
  within the one `gap-2.5` stack; `children` is the escape hatch for anything the
  declarative `stats[]` can't express (e.g. the status Errors card's live error line
  with a `StatusDot` and a count).
- **Always content-sized**: it never passes `scroll` to InfoPanel, so a long stat list
  grows the card rather than scrolling; use InfoPanel directly if scroll is needed.
- **`icon` is decorative**: InfoPanel marks the leading glyph `aria-hidden`, so the
  card's accessible name is the `title` alone — keep `title` a string for a named region.
- **Per-stat `tone`**: omitted `tone` falls back to StatRow's `neutral`; the card adds
  no tone of its own.

## Platform Notes

- **Swift / SwiftUI**: Not applicable: StatCard is a web-only React component. SwiftUI implementations of dashboard telemetry views would compose native UIKit views (UIStackView, custom label stacks, and system link controls) or SwiftUI equivalents (VStack, Text, Link), but the StatCard assembly pattern is web-specific.
- **Kotlin / Compose**: Not applicable: StatCard is a web-only React component. Compose implementations would use a Column layout with Row pairs for each stat, but the compound component and the footnote treatment pattern are tied to React's component model.
- **React / Web (TypeScript)**: `packages/web/packages/ui/src/blocks/stat-card.tsx`, exported from `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui` (`@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks/stat-card`). Composes `InfoPanel` (`../blocks/info-panel`), `StatRow` (`../components/stat`), and `ExternalLink` (`../components/external-link`). Exports `StatCard`, `StatCardProps`, and the `StatCardStat` type. Demo: `ui-showcase` Topic `stat-card` (group "Blocks — cards & sections"); the demo shows a Traffic card (declarative stats + footnote), an Errors card (stats + freeform children), and a monitor card (header `actions` status word, no link). Regenerate `sources.generated.ts` via `gen-sources.py` after source changes. Responsive: the demo lays the cards in a `sm:grid-cols-2` grid; each card is content-sized and full-width in its cell — verify at 375 / 768 / 1440.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: Not applicable: StatCard is a web-only React component. iOS/macOS implementations would use UIStackView (iOS) or NSStackView (macOS) for the vertical layout, with NSAttributedString for the muted footnote, but the component composition and mixed-content children pattern are web-specific.
- **WinUI 3**: Start with a `Border` (CornerRadius for rounded corners, BorderBrush for the card outline) containing a vertical `StackPanel` with Spacing=10 (for gap-2.5 equivalence). The header is a `Grid` with three columns: icon (Image or SymbolIcon), title (TextBlock with heading-level font), and actions (HyperlinkButton for the deep link). Bind the link's Visibility to Collapsed when the link prop is absent. The body is a nested StackPanel with Spacing=10, containing TextBlock pairs for each stat row (label and value), followed by a ContentPresenter for freeform children, and a TextBlock for the footnote (FontSize=10, Foreground set to secondary text color). Bind the footnote's Visibility to Collapsed when null. Use a Resources section to define color and typography tokens matching the design system.

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: StatCard is pure assembly of `InfoPanel` + `StatRow` + `ExternalLink`,
  owning only the body stack and footnote. **Rationale**: the "figure card with a
  deep link" shape recurred across the status board and admin console; centralizing
  the *arrangement* (not new chrome) keeps every such card identical and lets the
  parts evolve independently.
- **Decision**: stats are declarative (`stats[]`) with `children` as an escape hatch.
  **Rationale**: the common case (a list of label/value figures) is data, not markup;
  `children` covers the rare freeform tail (a live error line) without forcing every
  caller into imperative rows.
- **Decision**: the `link` maps to an `ExternalLink` in the InfoPanel actions slot.
  **Rationale**: a stat card almost always deep-links into its source tool (PostHog,
  GlitchTip); putting that "{tool} ↗" in the header's actions slot is the established
  dashboard grammar and keeps the affordance out of the figure rows.
- **Decision**: the footnote is a fixed muted mono 10px qualifier matched to the
  StatRow label. **Rationale**: caveats like "approximate · cookieless" read as chrome
  around the figures, so they share the label's micro-caption treatment rather than
  competing with the values.
- **Decision**: always content-sized (never `scroll`). **Rationale**: a stat card is a
  short, fixed set of figures; letting it grow keeps all figures visible, and callers
  needing a scrolling list use `InfoPanel` directly.
- **Decision**: `actions` is a passthrough slot rendered after the deep link, and host
  attributes spread onto the root. **Rationale**: the fleet status page's monitor card
  needed a live status word in the header and `data-*` hooks on the card root; exposing
  InfoPanel's existing slot and attribute spread keeps that card on the one StatCard
  grammar instead of forcing a site back onto raw InfoPanel + a duplicated footnote.
