# SplitDivider

## Overview

SplitDivider is a bare separator primitive that allows users to resize the space between two panes by dragging a divider or using keyboard controls. It reports a ratio (0–1) representing the fraction of the split given to the leading pane (above for horizontal, left for vertical). The component owns neither the panes nor any collapse state; the caller renders the regions and applies the ratio to layout. It is designed for layouts like search results / preview panes or repository tree / activity log pairs.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **separator-role**: Component MUST render an element with `role="separator"`.
- **ratio-change-callback**: Component MUST call `onRatioChange` with a new ratio when the user drags or operates keyboard/step controls.
- **ratio-clamp**: Component MUST clamp the reported ratio to the range `[minRatio, maxRatio]` before calling `onRatioChange`.
- **horizontal-orientation**: Component MUST support `orientation="horizontal"` (default), splitting vertical space with a horizontal line and responding to vertical drags and up/down arrow keys.
- **vertical-orientation**: Component MUST support `orientation="vertical"`, splitting horizontal space with a vertical line and responding to horizontal drags and left/right arrow keys.
- **ratio-prop**: Component MUST accept a `ratio` prop (0–1) and use it to set `aria-valuenow` as a percentage (rounded to nearest integer).
- **minmax-ratio-props**: Component MUST accept `minRatio` (default 0.2) and `maxRatio` (default 0.8) props and expose them as `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax` (as percentages).
- **container-ref**: Component MUST accept a `containerRef` prop (React.RefObject) pointing to the layout container and use it to measure pointer drag offsets.
- **drag-resize**: Component MUST support pointer drag to resize; on `pointerdown`, capture the pointer; on `pointermove`, calculate the new ratio as the pointer coordinate minus the container's leading edge (via `getBoundingClientRect`), divided by the container's extent; on `pointerup` or `pointercancel`, release capture and end the drag.
- **drag-end-on-release**: Component MUST end the drag if the primary pointer button is released mid-drag (checked via `(event.buttons & 1) === 0`).
- **step-button-pointerdown-guard**: A `pointerdown` on a step button MUST NOT start a drag on the separator; the buttons are siblings of the `role="separator"` element, outside its pointer-capture area.
- **zero-extent-guard**: Component MUST not apply a drag resize if the container extent (height for horizontal, width for vertical) is zero.
- **keyboard-shrink**: Component MUST decrement the ratio by `step` (default 0.03) on the shrink arrow (up for horizontal, left for vertical) and call `onRatioChange`.
- **keyboard-grow**: Component MUST increment the ratio by `step` on the grow arrow (down for horizontal, right for vertical) and call `onRatioChange`.
- **home-key**: Component MUST set the ratio to `minRatio` on Home key press.
- **end-key**: Component MUST set the ratio to `maxRatio` on End key press.
- **keyboard-default-prevention**: Component MUST call `preventDefault()` for every handled key (shrink/grow arrows, Home, End) so the page does not scroll while the separator is operated via keyboard.
- **visual-line**: Component MUST render a thin visual divider line (3px) centered in the 24px grab row/column, colored with `apt-border` and changing to `apt-border-strong` on hover and focus.
- **step-buttons**: Component MUST render two step buttons (24px × 24px, fully contained within the 24px grab row/column) for incrementing and decrementing the ratio, with aria-labels describing the resize direction.
- **step-button-mapping**: Component MUST render the two step buttons in a fixed order — a shrink button (decrements the ratio by `step` on click) followed by a grow button (increments the ratio by `step` on click) — each showing a directional glyph (▲/▼ for horizontal, shrink/grow respectively; ◀/▶ for vertical, shrink/grow respectively), positioned together near the trailing end of the grab strip (right edge for horizontal, bottom edge for vertical).
- **grab-cursor**: Component MUST apply `cursor-row-resize` for horizontal orientation and `cursor-col-resize` for vertical orientation.
- **grab-area-size**: Component MUST size the root row/column to 24px width (vertical) or height (horizontal) and full length on the opposite axis.
- **grab-area-focusable**: Component MUST set `tabIndex={0}` on the separator to make it keyboard-operable.
- **default-label**: Component MUST set `aria-label` to "Resize split" by default (overridable via the `label` prop).
- **step-button-labels**: Component MUST accept `growBottomLabel` and `growTopLabel` props for accessible step button labels; if not provided, MUST default to labels like "Grow bottom pane" (horizontal) or "Grow left pane" (vertical).
- **focus-ring**: Component MUST show a focus-visible ring (2px, `apt-gold/40`) when the separator receives keyboard focus, not on pointer focus.
- **classname-prop**: Component MUST accept a `className` prop for additional CSS classes on the root element.
- **touch-none**: Component MUST apply `touch-none` CSS class to prevent the default touch-drag behavior and allow the pointer handler to control resize.
- **select-none**: Component MUST apply `select-none` CSS class to prevent text selection during drag.

## Appearance

- **Width/Height**: 24px (6 units with `h-6` / `w-6` in Tailwind), full length on the opposite axis (full width for horizontal, full height for vertical).
- **Visual line**: 3px wide (horizontal) or 3px tall (vertical), `apt-border` color, centered in the 24px grab area.
- **Line hover state**: `apt-border-strong` color on hover.
- **Line focus state**: `apt-border-strong` color on focus.
- **Focus ring**: 2px solid ring, color `apt-gold/40`, visible only on keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`).
- **Step button size**: 24px × 24px, positioned absolutely within the grab area.
- **Step button colors**: `text-apt-text-muted` (default), `text-apt-text` on hover.
- **Step button icons**: Unicode arrow glyphs (▲/▼ for horizontal, ◀/▶ for vertical).
- **Corner radius**: 4px (`rounded-sm`) on the separator; 4px on step buttons.
- **Cursor**: `cursor-row-resize` for horizontal, `cursor-col-resize` for vertical.
- **Background**: Transparent (no explicit background color set).

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|-------|------------------|
| Default | Visual line is `apt-border`; step buttons are `text-apt-text-muted` |
| Hover | Visual line is `apt-border-strong`; step buttons are `text-apt-text` on hover |
| Keyboard focus | Visual line is `apt-border-strong`; 2px `apt-gold/40` focus ring visible |

## Accessibility

- **Role**: `role="separator"` per ARIA authoring practices for resizable panes.
- **Orientation**: `aria-orientation` matches the `orientation` prop (`horizontal` or `vertical`).
- **Value**: `aria-valuenow` (current ratio as percentage, 0–100), `aria-valuemin` (minimum ratio as percentage), `aria-valuemax` (maximum ratio as percentage), all rounded to the nearest integer.
- **Label**: `aria-label` provided for the separator (default "Resize split", overridable). Step buttons each have an `aria-label` (defaults: "Grow top pane" and "Grow bottom pane" for horizontal, "Grow left pane" and "Grow right pane" for vertical).
- **Keyboard navigation**: Component is focusable (`tabIndex={0}`) and supports keyboard resize: arrow keys (up/down for horizontal, left/right for vertical) adjust by `step`, Home sets to `minRatio`, End sets to `maxRatio`.
- **Dragging alternative**: WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.7 (Dragging Movements) — step buttons provide a single-pointer, non-drag resize alternative for users who cannot perform sustained drags.
- **Target size**: The 24px grab area (including both the visual line and step buttons) meets WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 (Target Size, Minimum) of at least 24×24px. No target bleeds into adjacent panes.
- **Hidden elements**: `aria-hidden="true"` is applied to the visual line and step button icons, as they are decorative and their roles are expressed via ARIA properties and labels.
- **Focus visible**: Focus ring is only shown on keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`), not on pointer focus, to avoid visual clutter during drag.

| split-divider-048 | drag-resize, keyboard-grow | User is dragging (a `pointermove` fires) while also pressing ArrowDown | `onRatioChange` is called for both the pointermove and the keydown; the ratio reflects whichever fired last |
| split-divider-049 | step-button-pointerdown-guard | A drag is in progress from pointer A; pointer B (a second touch) taps a step button | The step button's `onClick` fires immediately, independent of pointer A's drag |

## Edge Cases

- **Zero container extent**: If the container has zero height (horizontal) or zero width (vertical), drag calculations divide by zero. The component detects this and ignores the drag; the ratio remains unchanged until the container is resized.
- **Pointer cancel / lost capture**: If a gesture is cancelled (touch scroll takeover, window blur) or pointer capture is lost, the component ends the drag. Subsequent `pointermove` events do not resize.
- **Extreme ratios**: If `minRatio = 0` and `maxRatio = 1` (range 0–1), the entire spectrum of split sizes is allowed. If `minRatio = maxRatio`, the split is fixed and resize operations will always clamp to that single value.
- **Very large step**: If `step = 0.5`, each keyboard press moves the split by 50% of the container. The clamping logic ensures the ratio never exceeds `[minRatio, maxRatio]`.
- **Rapid key presses**: Repeated arrow key presses (e.g., held down) will call `onRatioChange` once per `onKeyDown` event, applying step adjustments in sequence. No debouncing is applied; all calls are clamped independently.
- **Simultaneous drag and key input**: If the user holds down an arrow key while dragging, both `pointermove` and `onKeyDown` will call `onRatioChange`. The component does not prevent this, and the ratio will be set by whichever input fired last.
- **Step button during drag**: `setPointerCapture` is scoped to the pointer id that started the drag, so a step-button click from that same pointer cannot occur — its `pointerdown`/`pointerup` are captured by the separator, not the button — until the drag ends. A click from a different pointer (e.g., a second touch) is independent of the drag and applies its `step` immediately.

## Configuration

Not applicable: The component has no configuration beyond its required and optional props. All behavior is controlled via props (`ratio`, `onRatioChange`, `minRatio`, `maxRatio`, `step`, `containerRef`, `orientation`, `label`, `growBottomLabel`, `growTopLabel`, `className`). There are no configuration files, environment variables, or runtime settings to manage.

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: SplitDivider is a layout primitive with no navigation or routing concerns. It does not emit navigable URLs, query parameters, or deep-link states. Deep linking responsibility belongs to the caller's container and routing system.

## Localization

The component accepts all user-facing strings via props (`label`, `growBottomLabel`, `growTopLabel`), leaving localization entirely to the caller. The defaults it falls back to when a prop is omitted ("Resize split", "Grow top/bottom pane", "Grow left/right pane") are hardcoded English fallback strings. Callers SHOULD pass localized strings for every label rather than relying on these defaults.

## Accessibility Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Reduce Motion | Not implemented in source. The component uses `transition-colors` on the visual line unconditionally and does not respond to `prefers-reduced-motion`. Callers SHOULD override the transition via CSS if reduced motion is required. |
| Increase Contrast | Not implemented in source. The component uses `apt-border` and `apt-border-strong` tokens, which are defined by the design system. Callers relying on increased contrast SHOULD provide theme overrides or use high-contrast token values. |
| Differentiate Without Color | The component distinguishes state primarily by visual cues: the thin line's color/position changes on hover and focus, and the step buttons display directional glyphs (▲/▼, ◀/▶) that persist regardless of color, satisfying WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.1 (Use of Color) for color-only signalling. Whether the line and the `apt-gold/40` focus ring also meet the 3:1 contrast that SC 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast) requires depends on the resolved values of the `apt-border`/`apt-gold` tokens, which the source does not resolve or verify — see the `contrast-ratio` compliance check below. |

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: The component has no feature flags, runtime toggles, or conditional behavior paths. All functionality is enabled by default and controlled via props. Feature gating is the caller's responsibility if needed.

## Analytics

Not applicable: The component does not emit analytics events, telemetry, or usage tracking. Event emission (e.g., "split_resized") is the caller's responsibility via callbacks passed to `onRatioChange`.

## Privacy

Not applicable: The component does not collect, store, or transmit personal data. The `ratio` value is layout state provided by the caller and does not represent personally identifiable information. All data flows through callbacks (`onRatioChange`) provided by the caller.

## Logging

Not applicable: The component does not emit log entries, diagnostics, or debugging output. Callers MAY add logging in their `onRatioChange` callback if needed for debugging or monitoring.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web** (source platform): The component is a React functional component (`SplitDivider`) defined in `split-divider.tsx`. It uses React hooks (`useRef`, `useCallback`) for state management and pointer/keyboard event handlers. Styling is applied via Tailwind CSS classes and `cn()` utility function (className merging). Colors use design-system tokens (`apt-border`, `apt-border-strong`, `apt-gold`, `apt-text`, `apt-text-muted`).
- **SwiftUI**: Use a custom view with `DragGesture` to track pointer drags (SwiftUI's `Divider` is not draggable). Accept the ratio as a `Binding<Double>` supplied by the caller — the component owns no panes or state — and keep only ephemeral `@State` for `isDragging`. Use `.onContinuousHover()` for the hover state color change. Keyboard input is handled via `.onKeyPress()`, or `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents(matching:handler:)` on macOS. Apply a 24pt width (or height for vertical) and show a thin line centered in it.
- **Compose** (Android/Kotlin): Start from Material 3's `HorizontalDivider`/`VerticalDivider` or a custom `Canvas`-based implementation. Use `Modifier.draggable()` and `Modifier.pointerInput()` to track drag gestures and pointer events. Implement keyboard handling via `Modifier.onKeyEvent()`. Hoist the ratio to the caller (a `Float` parameter plus an `onRatioChange: (Float) -> Unit` lambda, not an internally-owned `MutableState`), so the component owns no panes or state. Apply size constraints (24.dp width/height) and render a thin line in the center.
- **AppKit / UIKit** (macOS / iOS): On macOS, use a custom `NSView` with `NSPanGestureRecognizer` for drags and `NSResponder.interpretKeyEvents()` for keyboard input; report the ratio to the caller via a delegate or closure rather than owning it inside `NSSplitViewController`, which manages its own panes and would contradict this primitive's "owns no panes or state" contract. On iOS, use `UIPanGestureRecognizer` for drags (`UIDragInteraction` is for drag-and-drop, not resizing); keyboard input is less common on iOS but can be handled via `UIKeyCommand`. Render a 24pt divider with a thin line and step buttons.
- **WinUI 3** (Windows): Use `GridSplitter` (from the Community Toolkit's `Sizers` package — it is not part of WinUI 3 itself) or a custom `Control` with pointer and keyboard event handlers. Bind the ratio to a dependency property named `RatioProperty`. Implement `OnPointerPressed`, `OnPointerMoved`, `OnPointerReleased` for drag tracking. Use `OnKeyDown` for keyboard shortcuts (up/down arrows, Home, End). Apply a 24px width (or height for vertical). Render the divider and step buttons using XAML layouts (`StackPanel` for the row/column). Use WinUI 3 tokens and brushes for colors (`ControlStrokeColorDefault`, `ControlStrokeColorSecondary`, `AccentFillColorDefaultBrush`). Ensure the target size meets Microsoft accessibility standards (minimum 24×24px).

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: The entire 24px grab row/column is the drag target, not just the thin 3px visual line.
**Rationale**: WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 (Target Size, Minimum) requires a minimum 24×24px touch target; using the full 24px area keeps pointer and touch users within an accessible target while the visual line itself stays thin for minimal visual intrusion.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Two step buttons provide a non-drag alternative for resizing.
**Rationale**: WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.7 (Dragging Movements) requires a non-drag alternative for pointer users who cannot perform sustained drags; the step buttons allow incremental resize via single clicks/taps.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Keyboard support covers arrow keys (± `step`) plus Home/End (jump to `minRatio`/`maxRatio`).
**Rationale**: Arrow keys allow incremental adjustment aligned with the separator's axis; Home and End give quick access to the bounds.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Out-of-range ratios are silently clamped to `[minRatio, maxRatio]` rather than rejected with an error.
**Rationale**: Clamping prevents invalid states and simplifies the caller's logic; no validation error is emitted.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Pointer capture (`setPointerCapture`) is used during a drag.
**Rationale**: This is standard practice for resizable elements — it keeps the drag tracked even if the pointer moves outside the separator, and ensures smooth dragging behavior.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The component manages no "collapsed" state for either pane.
**Rationale**: Leaving collapse behavior to the caller gives maximum flexibility in how the split is used.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The ratio is computed from the pointer offset divided by the container's full extent, not from an absolute pixel delta.
**Rationale**: This makes the ratio represent a fraction of space independent of the container's absolute size.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The default `step` is `0.03` (3% per key press).
**Rationale**: This gives responsive keyboard navigation without requiring excessive key presses to traverse the full range; callers can override it for different responsiveness.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The default bounds are `minRatio = 0.2` and `maxRatio = 0.8`.
**Rationale**: Each pane keeps at least 20% of the space by default, preventing either pane from becoming unusably small; callers can override the bounds.
**Approved**: pending

These statuses rest on `split-divider.tsx`: the `role="separator"` element with `aria-label`, `aria-orientation`, and `aria-valuenow/min/max`, plus native `<button>` elements and the `onKeyDown` handler, support the passed screen-reader and keyboard checks, and the ARIA roles/states are all standard (semantic-markup). The `apt-border`/`apt-gold` design tokens and the fixed 24px grab area cannot be verified against a numeric 3:1 contrast ratio or a 44×44pt/48×48dp native touch-target minimum from the source alone (partial). `transition-colors` runs unconditionally with no `prefers-reduced-motion` guard in the source (failed). The default `label`, `growBottomLabel`, and `growTopLabel` values are hardcoded English literals, though every one is overridable via props (partial). `separation-of-concerns` passes because the drag/keyboard/clamp logic lives in named callbacks (`commit`, `onPointerMove`, `onKeyDown`, etc.) separate from the JSX they drive, and `unit-test-coverage` passes because `splitDivider.test.tsx` renders it directly and exercises both orientations' drag, keyboard, and step-button behavior.
