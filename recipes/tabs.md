# Tabs

## Overview

Tabs component provides a tabbed interface for organizing related content into labeled sections. A single tab list contains multiple tab buttons; only one tab is active at a time and displays its associated panel. Users can switch between tabs using mouse click, keyboard navigation (arrow keys), or programmatic control. Built as a composition of four primitives: `Tabs` (root container), `TabsList` (tab button container), `TabsTab` (individual tab button), and `TabsPanel` (content panel).

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-tab-list**: Component MUST render a container for tab buttons with a bottom border line separating tabs from content.
- **render-tabs**: Component MUST render individual clickable tab buttons within the tab list.
- **render-panels**: Component MUST render content panels that display content associated with each tab.
- **default-value**: Component MUST accept a `defaultValue` prop to specify which tab is active on initial render (uncontrolled mode).
- **controlled-value**: Component MUST also support controlled selection via a `value` prop paired with `onValueChange`, both passed through to Base UI's `Tabs.Root`.
- **active-indicator**: Component MUST render a 2px accent-colored border at the bottom of the active tab to indicate selection state.
- **disabled-tabs**: Component MUST respect a `disabled` attribute on individual tabs to block click-activation; the tab remains keyboard-focusable and visually unchanged (no opacity or cursor change — see **Appearance**).
- **click-selection**: Component MUST change the active tab when a user clicks any non-disabled tab button.
- **keyboard-tab-navigation**: Component MUST support Left/Right arrow-key and Home/End navigation among tabs, and roving-tabindex Tab-key entry/exit into the tablist, per Base UI's implementation of the WAI-ARIA APG Tabs pattern.
- **aria-tab-roles**: Component MUST expose `role="tablist"` on the tab container, `role="tab"` with `aria-selected` on each tab, and `role="tabpanel"` on each panel.
- **hover-emphasis**: Component tabs SHOULD change text color on hover to indicate interactivity (from muted to full contrast).
- **focus-visible-state**: Component tabs SHOULD indicate keyboard focus via `focus-visible` styling; the current treatment is a text-color change identical to the hover state, with no separate ring (`outline-none`).
- **class-name**: Component MUST accept a `className` prop for CSS class customization on the root container and each subcomponent.

## Appearance

- **Corner radius**: 0 (no rounding)
- **Padding—Tabs root**: flex column with 20px gap (`gap-5`)
- **Padding—TabsList**: bottom padding 0, inline elements with 16px gap horizontally (`gap-4`)
- **Padding—TabsTab**: 8px vertical, 4px horizontal (`py-2 px-1`)
- **Font—TabsTab**: monospace, 0.8rem (12.8px), weight 400 (normal), tracking-wide (letter-spacing increased)
- **Background**: transparent (no fill)
- **Foreground—inactive**: muted gray text (`apt-text-muted`)
- **Foreground—active**: full contrast text (`apt-text`), gold underline (`apt-gold`)
- **Foreground—hover**: full contrast text (`apt-text`)
- **Foreground—disabled**: none — the `disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50` classes are Tailwind `:disabled`-pseudo-class selectors, and Base UI's `TabsTab` sets `aria-disabled`/`data-disabled` rather than the native `disabled` attribute (it remains `focusableWhenDisabled`), so neither class ever matches; a disabled tab keeps full opacity, still responds to hover, and remains keyboard-focusable — only click-activation is blocked
- **Border—TabsList**: 1px bottom border in neutral border color (`apt-border`)
- **Border—active tab**: 2px bottom border in gold (`apt-gold`), positioned at bottom of tab (negative margin `-mb-px` to overlap list border)
- **Shadow**: none
- **Min/Max size**: no size constraints on Tabs root; `TabsTab` renders at approximately 33px tall — `text-[0.8rem]`'s default line-height (~15px) + `py-2`'s 16px total vertical padding + `border-b-2`'s 2px

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|-------|------------------|
| Default | Text muted gray, no underline (transparent 2px border), bottom border on list visible |
| Active | Text full contrast, gold 2px bottom border, border overrides list border |
| Hover | Text full contrast, no change to border (border state unchanged) |
| Focused | Text full contrast (via `focus-visible`), no distinct focus ring — visually identical to hover; see **focus-visible-state** |
| Disabled | No visual change (full opacity, still hovers); click-activation blocked, keyboard focus still lands on the tab |

## Accessibility

- **Role**: Component uses Base UI which applies `role="tablist"` to `TabsList`, `role="tab"` to each `TabsTab`, and `role="tabpanel"` to each `TabsPanel`.
- **Labels**: Tab buttons MUST contain visible text that describes the panel content (no aria-label unless text is insufficient).
- **Focus management**: Tab moves focus into the tablist as a single stop (landing on the active or last-focused tab, per the roving-tabindex pattern); Left/Right arrow keys then move focus between tabs, and Home/End move focus to the first/last tab — disabled tabs remain part of this focus order (`focusableWhenDisabled`) and are not skipped. This is Base UI's implementation of the WAI-ARIA APG Tabs pattern's roving-tabindex model, not standard sequential tab order. See **keyboard-tab-navigation**; RTL arrow-key reversal is documented under Localization.
- **State announcement**: Base UI applies `aria-selected="true"` to the active tab and `aria-selected="false"` to inactive tabs; screen readers announce selection state.
- **Disabled state**: Base UI applies `aria-disabled="true"` and a `data-disabled` attribute to a disabled `TabsTab`; it does not set the native `disabled` HTML attribute, so the tab stays in the keyboard focus order and only click-activation is blocked.
- **Minimum touch target**: Tab buttons MUST have a minimum height of 44px on touch platforms; current padding (`py-2`, 8px vertical) yields approximately 33px height; implementations on touch platforms SHOULD increase vertical padding or add touch-specific sizing.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| tabs-001 | render-tab-list | Render `<Tabs><TabsList>...</TabsList></Tabs>` | TabsList renders as flexbox container with bottom border |
| tabs-002 | render-tabs | Render `<TabsTab value="a">Label A</TabsTab>` | Tab renders as clickable button with text |
| tabs-003 | render-panels | Render `<TabsPanel value="a">Content</TabsPanel>` | Panel renders with content visible when tab "a" active |
| tabs-004 | default-value | Render `<Tabs defaultValue="b">` with two tabs | Tab "b" is active on initial render, not tab "a" |
| tabs-005 | active-indicator | Activate a tab by click or prop | Active tab shows gold 2px bottom border, inactive tabs show transparent border |
| tabs-006 | disabled-tabs | Render `<TabsTab value="x" disabled>` and click it | Tab does not change active state; the tab still shows full opacity, still responds to hover, and can still receive keyboard focus — only the click-activation is blocked |
| tabs-007 | click-selection | Click a non-disabled tab | Active state changes to that tab; associated panel content displays |
| tabs-008 | aria-tab-roles | Inspect rendered DOM | `role="tablist"` on `TabsList`; `role="tab"` with `aria-selected` on each `TabsTab`; `role="tabpanel"` on each `TabsPanel` |
| tabs-009 | hover-emphasis | Hover over an inactive tab | Text color changes from `apt-text-muted` to `apt-text`; border unchanged |
| tabs-010 | focus-visible-state | Tab to a tab via keyboard | Tab receives focus; text color changes via `focus-visible` (no ring, `outline-none`); visually identical to the hover state |
| tabs-011 | class-name | Pass `className="custom-class"` to Tabs/TabsList/TabsTab/TabsPanel | Custom class appended to element via `cn()` utility (Tailwind class merging) |
| tabs-012 | keyboard-tab-navigation | Focus a tab, press Right arrow | Focus moves to the next tab (including a disabled one); selection does not change, since `TabsList`'s `activateOnFocus` defaults to `false` |
| tabs-013 | keyboard-tab-navigation | Focus any tab, press End | Focus moves to the last tab, whether or not it is disabled |
| tabs-014 | controlled-value | Render with `value` and `onValueChange`, click a different tab | `onValueChange` is called with the new tab's value; the active tab only changes once the parent updates `value` in response |
| tabs-015 | default-value | Render `<Tabs>` with no `defaultValue`/`value` and tabs "a", "b" | The tab at index `0` ("a") is active, regardless of tab `value` strings |

## Edge Cases

- **Empty tabs**: If no `TabsTab` children are provided, `TabsList` MUST still render, empty. With no tab present, no panel is selectable.
- **Single tab**: A single tab with no alternative choice may be confusing to users. Component MUST still render and function correctly; design SHOULD consider whether a single tab adds value.
- **No defaultValue**: If both `defaultValue` and `value` are omitted, Base UI selects the tab at index `0` — not the first tab by string `value`. See **default-value**.
- **All tabs disabled**: If every `TabsTab` is disabled, the tab identified by `defaultValue`/`value` MUST remain selected and its panel MUST still display — `disabled` blocks interaction on that tab, it does not clear the Root's selection state. No tab's selection can be changed by click or keyboard while all are disabled, though keyboard focus can still move among the disabled tabs (`focusableWhenDisabled`).
- **Very long tab labels**: Tab text that exceeds container width may wrap or truncate depending on parent width. Component has no word-wrap or text-overflow rule; it MUST render the label as-is. Implementor SHOULD manage parent width constraints or truncate long labels.
- **Rapid tab switching**: Clicking multiple tabs in quick succession MUST result in the most recently clicked non-disabled tab being active; each click is a synchronous state update, and no debouncing is performed.
- **Null or undefined panel content**: If a `TabsPanel` has no children, it MUST render as an empty container without error.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `Tabs.defaultValue` | `string \| number` | `0` | Uncontrolled: which tab is active on initial render. Base UI defaults to index `0`, not a specific tab's `value` |
| `Tabs.value` | `string \| number` | — | Controlled: the active tab's value; pairs with `onValueChange` |
| `Tabs.onValueChange` | `(value: string \| number) => void` | — | Called when the user selects a different tab, so a controlled `value` can be updated |
| `TabsList.activateOnFocus` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether moving focus with arrow keys also changes the selected tab (`true`); by default, arrow keys move focus only and selection requires a separate click/activation |
| `Tabs.className` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes merged into the root `Tabs` element via `cn()` |
| `TabsList.className` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes merged into the `TabsList` element via `cn()` |
| `TabsTab.value` | `string \| number` | required | Identifies this tab; matched against `TabsPanel.value` to associate content |
| `TabsTab.disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Blocks click-activation for this tab; no visual change is applied (see **disabled-tabs**) and the tab remains keyboard-focusable |
| `TabsTab.className` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes merged into this tab's classes via `cn()` |
| `TabsPanel.value` | `string \| number` | required | Identifies which tab's content this panel renders |
| `TabsPanel.className` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes merged into this panel's classes via `cn()` |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: Tabs component is a UI primitive without built-in deep linking support. URL routing and tab state synchronization SHOULD be implemented at the page or application layer.

## Localization

| String Key | Default (en) | Context |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Tab labels | User-provided | Each `<TabsTab>` child is user-provided text; no built-in localization |
| Arrow-key direction | Left/Right (LTR) | In `dir="rtl"` contexts, Left/Right arrow-key semantics reverse (Left moves to the next tab, Right to the previous) to match reading direction, per the WAI-ARIA APG Tabs pattern that Base UI implements. See **keyboard-tab-navigation**. |

## Accessibility Options

- **Reduce Motion**: The hover/focus-visible text-color change uses Tailwind's `transition-colors` utility with no `motion-safe:`/`motion-reduce:` variant, so it does not automatically honor the OS reduced-motion preference — Tailwind's `transition-*` utilities apply unconditionally unless a `motion-*` variant is added. Consumers needing strict reduced-motion compliance should override with a `motion-reduce:transition-none` class.
- **Increase Contrast**: Component text and borders use CSS custom properties (`apt-text`, `apt-gold`, `apt-border`) which SHOULD be overridden in high-contrast themes. Not a component responsibility.
- **Differentiate Without Color**: Component uses both color (gold) and position (border underline) to indicate active state; active state is distinguishable without color alone.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: Tabs component is a base UI primitive with no feature flag control in source code.

## Analytics

Not applicable: Component emits no built-in analytics events. Analytics instrumentation is the responsibility of the consuming application.

## Privacy

Not applicable: Component processes no user data beyond interaction events (click, focus) which are local to the browser and not transmitted.

## Logging

Not applicable: Component performs no internal logging.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web**: Component wraps `@base-ui/react/tabs` (`TabsPrimitive`) — see **aria-tab-roles**, **keyboard-tab-navigation**, and **controlled-value**, which this component satisfies by delegating to Base UI's `Tabs.Root` / `Tabs.List` / `Tabs.Tab` / `Tabs.Panel`. Files: `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/tabs.tsx`. Uses Tailwind CSS utilities for styling. Active state is indicated via the `data-[active]` attribute selector Base UI applies to the selected `Tab`; styling keys off this attribute. The `cn()` utility merges additional `className` props on every subcomponent.

- **SwiftUI**: For in-content tabs (not app-level navigation), use a segmented `Picker(selection:)` bound to a `@State` value, paired with a manual content switch (`if`/`switch` over the selection) to show the associated panel. `TabView` is reserved for app-level/root navigation (tab bar), not in-content component tabs, and `.tabViewStyle(.segmented)` does not exist as an API. No gold color by default; map `apt-gold` to a custom accent `Color`.

- **Compose**: Material 3's `PrimaryTabRow` (or `SecondaryTabRow`) composable — or the plain `TabRow` on older Material versions — containing `Tab` composables. Active tab is managed via `selectedTabIndex: Int` state. Disabled tabs via the `enabled` parameter on `Tab`. Customize the underline indicator via the `indicator` parameter (not `indicatorContent`). No monospace font by default; apply `FontFamily.Monospace`.

- **AppKit / UIKit**: Native `NSTabView` (macOS) or custom `UIView` composition (iOS) provides tabbed interface. iOS typically uses `UISegmentedControl` or custom button stack. Underline indicator requires custom implementation via `CALayer` or view positioning. Disabled state via `isEnabled` property. Focus management via `becomeFirstResponder()`.

- **WinUI 3**: For in-content section tabs, prefer `SelectorBar` (with `SelectorBarItem` entries) or `Pivot`; native `TabView` is designed for closable, document-style tabs (browser-tab UX) and shows close buttons by default — if used for section tabs anyway, set `IsClosable="False"` on each `TabViewItem`. Active item via `SelectedIndex`/`SelectedItem`. Disabled tab via `IsEnabled="False"`. Underline/indicator customization via `SelectorBarItem` styling or `TabViewItemHeaderBackground`; map `apt-gold` to `AccentFillColorDefaultBrush` or a custom brush.

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: Use a gold bottom-border underline (an accent indicator) rather than a filled pill or box background for the active tab.
  **Rationale**: An underline maintains minimal visual weight and distinguishes the active tab while keeping focus on content; this matches the hub's `/home` tab bar treatment, per the source implementation comment.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: Use a monospace font (`font-mono`) with increased letter-spacing (`tracking-wide`) for all tab labels.
  **Rationale**: Gives a technical appearance and improves readability of tab labels, especially when labels are short identifiers or status codes.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: Use flex layout with `gap` utilities (`flex flex-col gap-5` on root, `flex items-end gap-4` on `TabsList`) instead of hard-coded margins.
  **Rationale**: Provides predictable spacing and alignment without per-child margin bookkeeping.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: Shift the active tab's border with a negative margin (`-mb-px`) so its 2px gold border overlaps and visually replaces the `TabsList`'s 1px bottom border.
  **Rationale**: Creates a seamless transition from list border to tab underline instead of a visible seam between the two borders.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: Ship `disabled:opacity-50`/`disabled:pointer-events-none` classes that key off the native `:disabled` pseudo-class, even though Base UI's `TabsTab` never sets the native `disabled` attribute (it uses `aria-disabled`/`data-disabled` instead), so the classes never take effect and a disabled tab shows no visual change.
  **Rationale**: Source bug, not a deliberate design choice — the intended dimmed treatment does not render; see `SP/fix/source-bugs.txt`.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: Build on Base UI's `Tabs` primitive rather than rolling custom tab logic.
  **Rationale**: Base UI provides ARIA compliance (**aria-tab-roles**), keyboard navigation (**keyboard-tab-navigation**), and focus management out of the box; building on a headless primitive is more maintainable than reimplementing tab semantics.
  **Approved**: pending

Statuses rest on: the source's delegation to Base UI for ARIA roles, keyboard handling, and focus order (screen-reader-support, keyboard-navigable, semantic-markup, focus-management — all passed); the fixed `text-[0.8rem]` sizing and the `apt-*` color tokens whose actual values aren't visible in this source file (dynamic-type-support, contrast-ratio — partial); the ~33px computed tab height and the `transition-colors` utility with no `motion-reduce:` variant (touch-target-size, reduced-motion — failed); and the absence of any word-wrap/truncation handling for user-provided tab-label text plus the unverified RTL mirroring of the plain flex layout (text-expansion-tolerance — failed, rtl-layout-support — partial); the four exports are thin themed wrappers around Base UI's `Tabs` primitives with no logic of their own (separation-of-concerns passed), and no test file in the web workspace imports `Tabs`/`TabsList`/`TabsTab`/`TabsPanel` from this source — the candidate tests matched by name test unrelated markdown/window-drawer/split-view surfaces (unit-test-coverage failed).
