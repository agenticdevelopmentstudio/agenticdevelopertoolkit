# DataTable

## Overview

A generic, selectable, optionally-sortable, optionally-reorderable table primitive in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui`.
It is a **controlled** table: the caller owns `rows`, the `selectedIds` set, and
the optional `sort`. The component renders columns, handles pointer + keyboard
selection, and reports changes up. It is generic over the row type `T` and owns
the multi-row selection model (click / ⇧-click / ⌥-click / keyboard). It is the
foundation for `ListWithDetailsPane` and `AddUsersModal`.

## Behavioral Requirements

### Selection and Focus

- **click-selects-row**: On a plain click of a row, the component MUST set the selection to exactly `{id}` and set the internal anchor to that id.
- **shift-click-extends-range**: On ⇧-click of a row, the component MUST set the selection to the contiguous range from the anchor to the clicked id (in the current `rows` order) and MUST leave the anchor unchanged.
- **alt-click-adds-to-selection**: On ⌥/Alt-click of a row, the component MUST add that id to the selection (leaving the selection unchanged if it is already present) and MUST set the anchor to that id. There is no ⌘/Ctrl-click binding on the pointer path; ⌘/Ctrl is not read by the click handler.
- **arrow-key-moves-selection**: When the grid is focused, ↑/↓ MUST set the selection to the previous/next row's id, set the anchor to it, and clamp at the first/last row.
- **shift-arrow-extends-range**: ⇧+↑/⇧+↓ MUST extend the selection one row from the anchor.
- **space-toggles-focused-row**: Space MUST toggle the focused row in or out of the selection.
- **selection-by-id**: The component MUST track selection by id (not row position) so it survives re-sorts and filters.
- **onselectionchange-new-set**: Every selection edit MUST be reported via `onSelectionChange` with a new `Set` instance (the set is owned by the caller).
- **pointer-no-focus-steal**: Pointer selection MUST NOT steal focus from an open editor elsewhere on the page.

### Sorting

- **no-internal-sort**: The component MUST NOT sort `rows` internally; it MUST report sort intent via `onSortChange` and render `rows` in the given order.
- **inert-sort-when-no-handler**: When `onSortChange` is omitted, sortable headers MUST render inert (no sort affordance fires).

### Row Activation

- **double-click-activates-row**: When `onRowActivate` is provided, double-clicking a row MUST invoke `onRowActivate` with that row's id, unless the click originated from an in-cell control.
- **enter-activates-focused-row**: When `onRowActivate` is provided and the table is selectable, pressing Enter MUST invoke `onRowActivate` with the currently focused row's id.

### Column Sizing (`autoSizeColumns`, opt-in)

- **size-columns-to-widest-cell**: With `autoSizeColumns`, a column with no declared `width` MUST be as wide as its WIDEST cell — measured across the header and every row, so all rows share one track and the columns LINE UP. A `max-content` track alone does NOT satisfy this: each row is its own grid (it must be, to carry the row's background/selection), so `max-content` would size every row independently and the header would not align with the body. The component therefore renders one pass at `max-content` (each cell at its natural width), measures the widest cell per column, and locks that in as an explicit px track — both passes BEFORE paint, so no misaligned frame is ever shown. It MUST re-measure when the rows or columns change.
- **resize-columns-by-drag**: With `autoSizeColumns`, each column (except one marked `resizable: false`) MUST offer a drag handle on its TRAILING border that sets an explicit width; DOUBLE-CLICKING the handle MUST clear it, springing the column back to fitting its content. A dragged width MUST win over the measured one, and MUST NOT go below a legible minimum (48px).
- **persist-column-widths**: Given `columnWidthsKey`, the dragged widths MUST persist (localStorage under key `data-table-cols:{columnWidthsKey}`) so a table remembers its layout across visits.
- **fill-slack-not-stretch**: Content-sized columns MUST pack to the leading edge — a trailing filler track absorbs any leftover width — rather than stretching to fill the table.
- **truncate-when-dragged-narrow**: A column dragged NARROWER than its content MUST ellipsise, never reflow (which would knock every row out of vertical alignment).

### Reordering (`reorder`, opt-in)

- **enable-row-drag-to-reorder**: When `reorder` is provided, rows MUST be draggable; releasing a row over the table MUST invoke `reorder.onDrop` with a `SortableDrop` object describing the new position.
- **respect-candrag-check**: When `reorder.canDrag` is provided, a row MUST NOT be draggable if `canDrag(id)` returns false.
- **announce-drag-state**: When a row is picked up, dragged, or dropped, the component MUST emit accessible announcements describing the row and the drop zone using `reorder.describeRow` (or the row's `describeRow` function, or a fallback description).

Whether reordering should be disabled while a sort or filter is in force is a caller obligation, not a component behavior — see **Design Decisions**.

### Selection Checkboxes (`showSelectionCheckboxes`, opt-in)

- **add-leading-checkbox-column**: When `showSelectionCheckboxes` is true and the table is selectable, the component MUST add a leading checkbox column that displays one checkbox per row.
- **include-select-all**: The selection checkbox column header MUST include a "Select all" checkbox that toggles the selection state of every visible row (not other pages or filters).
- **label-checkboxes**: Each row's checkbox MUST have an accessible label derived from `describeRow(row)` if provided, or by looking for the first non-empty string field in the row that is not the id, or falling back to `row {id}`.
- **checkbox-click-not-select-row**: Clicking a selection checkbox MUST NOT trigger the row's own selection handling; it MUST only toggle that row's checkbox.

### Inline-Editable Cells

- **not-hijack-cell-controls**: The selectable grid's keyboard/pointer machinery MUST ignore events that originate from a control INSIDE a cell (input / textarea / select / button / link / contenteditable / `[role='button']`). Its Arrow/Space handlers call `preventDefault`, which would swallow a space typed into an inline editor or a native select's keyboard use; and its mousedown-`preventDefault` would stop the control taking focus at all. Without this, selection and inline editing are mutually exclusive — a selectable table could not host an editable cell. A click on an in-cell control MUST still select its row (so a details pane follows the row being edited) while leaving the control's own click intact.

### Empty and Loading States

- **renders-empty-state**: When `rows` is empty and `loading` is false, the component MUST render `emptyLabel` in place of rows.
- **renders-loading-state**: When `loading` is true, the component MUST render a loading affordance (`role="status"`) instead of rows, taking precedence over the empty state.

### Action-List Mode (Unselectable)

- **action-list-mode-when-unselectable**: When BOTH `selectedIds` and `onSelectionChange` are omitted, the component MUST render rows with no selection affordance — no `aria-selected`, no `data-selected`, no pointer cursor, and clicking a row MUST NOT select it — so in-cell controls (buttons, menus) own the interaction.

## Appearance

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☐ │ Name ▲     │ Email          │ Phone           │  ← sticky header (sortable = button + caret; ☐ = select-all)
├────┼────────────┼────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ ☐  │ Ada        │ ada@x.io       │ +1 555 0100     │  ← row (aria-selected)
│ ☑  │ Grace      │ grace@x.io     │ +1 555 0101     │  ← selected row (bg-apt-gold/15)
└────┴────────────┴────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

- Container: `border border-apt-border rounded-lg overflow-auto`.
- Header: `bg-apt-surface-2`, sticky (`position: sticky; top: 0`), `text-apt-text-muted`, mono caption style; a sortable header is a `<button>` with a `ChevronUp`/`ChevronDown` caret in `apt-text-muted`.
- Row: `text-apt-text`, hover `bg-apt-surface-2`, selected `bg-apt-gold/15`; divider `border-t border-apt-border`.
- Selection checkbox column: width `2.75rem`, not resizable.
- Column widths come from a CSS grid template built from each column's `width` — or, with `autoSizeColumns`, from the measured width of each column's widest cell, which the user may override by dragging the column's trailing border (`cursor-col-resize`, `hover:bg-apt-gold/40`, matching the topic list's rail handle).
- Resize handle: `absolute top-0 right-0 h-full w-1.5 translate-x-1/2` on the trailing border of each resizable column header.
- No raw hex; no `!important`.

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|---|---|
| Default row | `text-apt-text`, transparent background |
| Hover row | `bg-apt-surface-2` |
| Selected row | `bg-apt-gold/15`, `aria-selected="true"`, `data-selected` |
| Keyboard-focused row | roving `data-focused="true"`; `aria-activedescendant` points at it |
| Dragging row | row's transform reflects pointer position (dnd-kit) |
| Sortable header (active) | `aria-sort` set to "ascending" or "descending"; caret reflects direction |
| Loading | loading affordance shown in place of rows (status message) |
| Empty | `emptyLabel` (default "No items.") shown |

## Accessibility

- `role="grid"` (selectable) or `role="table"` (action-list) with `aria-label`; header is `role="row"` / `role="columnheader"` (sortable headers set `aria-sort` to "ascending" or "descending"); body rows are `role="row"` with `aria-selected` (selectable only); cells are `role="gridcell"` (selectable) or `role="cell"` (action-list).
- The grid is focusable (`tabIndex=0`) when selectable; a roving `data-focused` attribute tracks keyboard focus; `aria-activedescendant` points at it.
- Pointer selection does not steal focus from an open editor elsewhere.
- Selection checkboxes have accessible labels derived from row content (`Select Ada`, `Select Grace`).
- Sortable headers are buttons with `aria-sort` attributes.
- Column resize handles are separators with `aria-orientation="vertical"` and `aria-label="Resize column {key}"`.
- Drag operations emit accessible announcements via the dnd system (row name, drop zone name).
- Loading state uses `role="status"` for the affordance message.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | click-selects-row | click row Ada | selection = `{Ada}`, anchor = Ada |
| T2 | shift-click-extends-range | click Ada, ⇧-click Grace | selection = contiguous Ada…Grace |
| T3 | alt-click-adds-to-selection | ⌥-click an unselected row | row added to selection, anchor set to it |
| T3b | alt-click-adds-to-selection | ⌥-click an already-selected row | selection unchanged |
| T4 | arrow-key-moves-selection | focus grid, press ↓ | selection moves to next row, clamps at end |
| T5 | shift-arrow-extends-range | anchor set, ⇧+↓ | range extends one row from anchor |
| T6 | space-toggles-focused-row | focus row, press Space | focused row toggles |
| T7 | no-internal-sort | click sortable header | `onSortChange` fires with toggled dir; `rows` unchanged by component |
| T8 | selection-by-id | reorder `rows` after selecting | selection preserved across reorder |
| T9 | inert-sort-when-no-handler | render without `onSortChange`, click a sortable header | no sort affordance fires; `onSortChange` is never called |
| T10 | action-list-mode-when-unselectable | render without `selectedIds`/`onSelectionChange`; click a row | rows carry no `aria-selected`/`data-selected`, no pointer cursor; the click selects nothing; in-cell buttons remain operable |
| T11 | double-click-activates-row | double-click row with `onRowActivate` | `onRowActivate(id)` fires |
| T11b | double-click-activates-row | double-click an in-cell control (e.g. a button) with `onRowActivate` provided | `onRowActivate` does not fire; the control's own double-click behavior is unaffected |
| T12 | enter-activates-focused-row | focus row, press Enter with `onRowActivate` | `onRowActivate(id)` fires |
| T13 | size-columns-to-widest-cell | render with `autoSizeColumns: true` | header and body cells align; column is as wide as widest cell |
| T14 | resize-columns-by-drag | drag column header's trailing border | column width changes |
| T15 | truncate-when-dragged-narrow | drag column narrower than content | cell text ellipsises; row heights remain aligned |
| T16 | enable-row-drag-to-reorder | drag row with `reorder` prop | `reorder.onDrop` fires with new position |
| T17 | respect-candrag-check | drag row where `canDrag(id)` = false | row does not enter dragged state; `onDrop` does not fire |
| T18 | add-leading-checkbox-column | render with `showSelectionCheckboxes: true` | leading column added with checkbox per row |
| T19 | include-select-all | click "Select all" checkbox | all visible rows selected |
| T20 | checkbox-click-not-select-row | click row checkbox | checkbox toggles; `onSelectionChange` fires; the row's own click-selection handling does not fire |
| T21 | onselectionchange-new-set | click row Ada, capture the `Set` passed to `onSelectionChange`, then click row Grace | the second call receives a new `Set` instance, distinct from the first |
| T22 | pointer-no-focus-steal | focus an in-cell editor elsewhere on the page, then mousedown a row (not on an in-cell control) | the editor keeps focus; the grid does not receive it |
| T23 | persist-column-widths | drag a column with `columnWidthsKey` set, then remount the table with the same key | the dragged width is read back from `localStorage` and applied |
| T24 | fill-slack-not-stretch | render with `autoSizeColumns: true` and columns narrower than the container | a trailing filler track absorbs the slack; content-sized columns stay left-packed |
| T25 | not-hijack-cell-controls | focus an in-cell `<input>`, press Space | the grid's Space handler does not fire; the input receives the space character |
| T26 | announce-drag-state | pick up a row via `reorder` | an accessible announcement naming the row and drop zone is emitted |
| T27 | label-checkboxes | render a row checkbox with no `describeRow` prop and no other non-empty string field on the row | checkbox `aria-label` falls back to `row {id}` |
| T28 | renders-empty-state | render with `rows: []`, `loading: false` | `emptyLabel` is shown in place of rows |
| T29 | renders-loading-state | render with `loading: true` and non-empty `rows` | the `role="status"` loading affordance is shown instead of rows |

## Edge Cases

- The ⇧-click range is computed over the **current visible order** of `rows`.
- Ids no longer present in `rows` are pruned by the caller, not the component.
- With `onSortChange` omitted, sortable headers are inert (no sorting offered).
- `loading` and an empty `rows` array each render their dedicated state; `loading` takes precedence.
- The "Select all" checkbox is a plain boolean toggle, not tri-state/indeterminate: it is checked only when every row in the current `rows` array is selected. Clicking it again in that state clears those rows rather than being a no-op, while selections outside the current `rows` array (other pages, filtered-out rows) are left untouched either way.
- Clicking a sortable header cycles between two states, not three: a header that is unsorted, sorted on a different column, or sorted descending on this column goes to ascending on the next click; a header already ascending on this column goes to descending. There is no click that returns a column to unsorted — the caller clears `sort` itself for that.
- Column widths loaded from `localStorage` are parsed as JSON; a parse failure falls back to an empty width map (so all columns behave as freshly measured). The parsed value's shape — that each entry is actually a number — is not validated beyond that.
- If localStorage is full or access is blocked, widths still apply for the session but are not persisted.
- A column dragged narrower than 48px is clamped to that minimum.
- A drag-to-reorder gesture, picked up from the row's drag handle, does not also select the row — dragging and selecting are different acts. This is distinct from a plain click landing on an in-cell control, which still selects the row per **not-hijack-cell-controls**.
- Double-click activation (`onRowActivate`) fires in action-list mode as well as in a selectable table — it is gated only on `onRowActivate` being provided, not on `selectedIds`/`onSelectionChange`. Enter activation, by contrast, is reachable only when the grid is selectable, because only the selectable grid attaches a key handler at all.
- When the focused row's id is no longer present in `rows`, the component does not reset `aria-activedescendant` or internal focus tracking on its own; the caller is expected to keep `selectedIds` (and, indirectly, focus) in sync with `rows`.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `columns` | `DataTableColumn<T>[]` | — | Column definitions. |
| `rows` | `T[]` | — | Rows already in display order. |
| `getRowId` | `(row: T) => string` | — | Stable id for a row. |
| `selectedIds` | `Set<string>?` | — | Caller-owned selection set. Omit (with `onSelectionChange`) for action-list mode. |
| `onSelectionChange` | `((ids: Set<string>) => void)?` | — | Fired with a new `Set` on every selection edit. Omitting it disables selection entirely (action-list mode). |
| `onRowActivate` | `((id: string) => void)?` | — | Fired when a row is double-clicked or Enter is pressed on the focused row (only when table is selectable). |
| `sort` | `{ key: string; dir: "asc" \| "desc" }`? | — | Current sort (caller reorders `rows`). |
| `onSortChange` | `(sort) => void`? | — | Sort intent; if omitted, headers are inert. |
| `emptyLabel` | `string` | `"No items."` | Shown when `rows` is empty. |
| `loading` | `boolean` | `false` | Renders the loading state. |
| `ariaLabel` | `string` | — | Required grid label. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes on the container. |
| `autoSizeColumns` | `boolean` | `false` | Size columns to widest cell and allow user resizing. |
| `columnWidthsKey` | `string?` | — | Persist dragged column widths under this localStorage key. |
| `reorder` | `DataTableReorder?` | — | Enable row reordering via drag-and-drop. |
| `showSelectionCheckboxes` | `boolean` | `false` | Show a leading checkbox column (only if selectable). |
| `describeRow` | `(row: T) => string`? | — | Accessible label for a row (used in checkboxes and drag announcements). |

Column fields: `key: string`, `header: React.ReactNode`, `render?: (row: T, ctx: DataTableRowContext) => React.ReactNode` (default `String(row[key])`), `sortable?: boolean`, `width?: string` (e.g. `"12rem"` / `"1fr"`), `align?: "start" | "end"`, `resizable?: boolean`.

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: DataTable is a presentational primitive with no routing or URL-based state.

## Localization

Most user-facing text is caller-supplied (`ariaLabel`, `emptyLabel`, column `header`, `describeRow`), and localization of those is the caller's responsibility. The component itself also owns a small set of hardcoded English strings that have no override besides `emptyLabel`:

| String | Context |
|---|---|
| `"Select all"` | Select-all checkbox `aria-label`, shown when `showSelectionCheckboxes` is true |
| `"No items."` | Default `emptyLabel`; overridable via that prop |
| `` `row {id}` `` | Fallback row-checkbox `aria-label` when no `describeRow` is given and the row has no other non-empty string field |
| `` `Select {name}` `` | Row-checkbox `aria-label` template, `{name}` from `describeRow(row)` or the fallback above |
| `` `Resize column {key}` `` | Column resize-handle `aria-label`, built from the column `key` rather than its header text |

These literals are not routed through any localization layer; a non-English caller sees them in English regardless of locale.

## Accessibility Options

| Option | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Reduce Motion | Not honored: a dragged row's transform (`drag?.style`) is applied unconditionally, with no `prefers-reduced-motion` check. |
| Increase Contrast | Not applicable: DataTable renders no direct colors — foreground/background come entirely from the caller's `apt-*` design tokens. |
| Differentiate Without Color | Partially addressed: selection is conveyed through `aria-selected`/`data-selected` plus a background tint together, not color alone, but no additional non-color marker (e.g. an icon) is added. |

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: DataTable is a foundational primitive with no feature-gated behavior; feature gates on features using the table belong in the consuming application.

## Analytics

Not applicable: DataTable is a presentational primitive; it emits no structured log events or analytics. Consumer applications instrument their own models when a row is activated or the selection changes.

## Privacy

Not applicable: DataTable does not collect, store, or transmit user data. Row content is entirely caller-owned and may be sanitized by the caller before rendering.

## Logging

Not applicable: DataTable is a presentational primitive; it emits no structured log events. Consumers log events of interest (row activation, selection changes) in their own handlers.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web**: Source file is `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/data-table.tsx` (exported via the `./components/*` wildcard). Uses CSS Grid for layout, dnd-kit for drag-and-drop (via `SortableItem`, `SortableSurface`, `SortableZone`), and lucide-react for sort carets (`ChevronUp`, `ChevronDown`). Checkbox cells use a separate `Checkbox` component from the same UI package. Storage is via localStorage for column widths.
- **SwiftUI**: `Table` is available from iOS 16 / macOS 12 and resizes its columns natively on macOS. For earlier OS versions, use a `List` with `.listStyle(.insetGrouped)` (there is no `.inset(grouped)` modifier). Selection maps to a SwiftUI `@State` binding tracking `Set<ID>`. Sorting maps to a data-binding holding the current sort column and direction; the table does not reorder rows itself. Column reorder is not a native `Table` affordance; consider `List` with custom drag-and-drop or a third-party component for that.
- **Compose**: Start from a `LazyColumn` or `Column` with a custom row layout per column definition. Selection uses a mutable state `Set<ID>` held at the caller level. Sorting is caller-driven via a state binding; the component renders `rows` as given. Column resize and reorder require custom Modifier-based drag-and-drop handlers — dnd-kit is web-only and has no Compose equivalent; use Compose's pointer-input APIs or a Compose-native drag-and-drop library instead.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: macOS (AppKit): start from `NSTableView` with `NSTableColumn` per column; selection maps to `selectedRowIndexes` binding. iOS (UIKit): `UITableView` is single-column, so use `UICollectionView` with a custom `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` for multi-column grids. Selection uses `UICollectionViewDelegate.didSelectItemAt` and an index-to-id mapping; sorting is caller-driven. Column resize and reorder (iOS) are limited; macOS `NSTableView` offers native resize.
- **WinUI 3**: Start from `DataGrid` (`CommunityToolkit.WinUI.Controls`, not `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls`) or `ItemsView` with `ItemsRepeater` rows. Selection: use `DataGrid.SelectionMode = "Multiple"` or bind `SelectedItems` to a collection; track by id via a data object. Sorting: use `DataGrid` built-in sorting or manage `SortDescription` in a `CollectionViewSource` wrapping `rows`. Column resize: `DataGrid` columns are natively resizable; set `CanUserResizeColumns="True"`. Reorder: `DataGrid` does not natively reorder rows; use `ItemsRepeater` with `DragItemsStartingEventArgs` / `DragItemsCompletedEventArgs` or wire an external reordering gesture handler.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: The component reports `onSortChange` and renders `rows` as given, rather than sorting internally.
**Rationale**: Keeps sorting policy with the data owner rather than duplicating it inside the table.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Selection is a capability, not a mandate — omitting `selectedIds`/`onSelectionChange` turns the same grid into an action-list table.
**Rationale**: Sites never fork a second table for rows whose interaction lives entirely in per-cell controls (admin's users/flags/feedback/api-tokens lists).
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The anchor id used for range selection is internal state, not part of the public API.
**Rationale**: It is only ever used to compute shift-click ranges and has no meaning to a caller.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Row activation is a separate act from selection — click selects, double-click (or Enter) activates.
**Rationale**: Lets one table support multi-select (bulk actions) and row opening (a details view) without the two conflicting.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Reordering is opt-in (`reorder`) and independent of sorting; the component does not itself disable reordering when a sort or filter is active.
**Rationale**: A dragged row's new position would describe the filtered/sorted view rather than the underlying list, so reordering while sorted is misleading — but enforcing that is a caller obligation the component leaves to the caller, who simply omits `reorder` when a sort or filter is in force.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The table does not hijack keyboard or pointer events from in-cell controls (inputs, selects, buttons, contenteditable).
**Rationale**: Lets a row be selected (driving a details pane) while remaining inline-editable, instead of making selection and inline editing mutually exclusive.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: With `autoSizeColumns: true`, the component renders once at `max-content` (measuring each cell), then locks in explicit widths for a second pass.
**Rationale**: Each row is its own grid, so a single `max-content` pass would size every row independently and the header would not align with the body. Both passes complete before paint, so no misaligned frame is ever visible.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Column auto-sizing, drag-resize, persistence, and row reorder are kept as internal behavior of `DataTable` rather than split into separate hooks or wrapper components.
**Rationale**: Both features build on state the table already computes once per render — `ids` and `renderedColumns` — that reorder's `SortableZone`/`SortableSurface` and the auto-size measuring pass both read directly. Extracting either into a standalone hook or wrapper would mean re-threading that same state across a new boundary for every consumer, in exchange for splitting up a table that, as built, has one render pass and one set of derived ids to keep in sync.
**Approved**: pending

`screen-reader-support`, `focus-management`, and `semantic-markup` rest on the `role`/`aria-*` attributes the source sets on the grid, rows, cells, headers, and resize handles. `keyboard-navigable` is partial because selection, activation, and sorting are fully keyboard-operable but column resize and row reorder have no keyboard path in this source. `dynamic-type-support` and `contrast-ratio` are partial because the source uses relative Tailwind sizing and design tokens without verifying either against a scaling or contrast requirement. `touch-target-size` is partial because the resize handle (`w-1.5`, 6px) is well under a legible target and checkbox sizing is delegated to the `Checkbox` component. `reduced-motion` fails because the drag transform (`drag?.style`) is applied unconditionally with no `prefers-reduced-motion` check. `string-externalization` and `no-hardcoded-strings` fail because of the literal strings listed under Localization. `text-expansion-tolerance` fails because cells `truncate` rather than reflow. `rtl-layout-support` is partial because the resize handle is positioned with physical `right-0`/`translate-x-1/2` rather than a logical (start/end) property. `unicode-support` passes because row content renders through ordinary React string interpolation with no charset restriction. `safe-defaults` passes because every added-surface prop (`autoSizeColumns`, `reorder`, `showSelectionCheckboxes`) defaults to off/undefined.

## Change History

| Version | Date | Author | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0.0 | 2026-06-26 | Mike Fullerton | Initial conversion from legacy UI spec. |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-07-03 | Mike Fullerton | Selection made optional: omitting selectedIds/onSelectionChange yields action-list mode (no aria-selected, inert rows, in-cell controls own interaction). |
| 1.2.0 | 2026-07-11 | Mike Fullerton | **Content-sized + user-resizable columns** (`autoSizeColumns`, `columnWidthsKey`, per-column `resizable`), and **selectable tables can now host inline editors**. Sizing: a `max-content` track cannot do this on its own, because each row is its own grid — it would size every row independently and the header would not line up with the body. So the table renders one pass at `max-content`, measures the widest cell per column, and locks that in as an explicit px track shared by every row (both passes pre-paint, so no misaligned frame is shown), re-measuring when rows/columns change. A drag handle on each column's trailing border overrides the measured width; double-click springs it back; widths optionally persist. Editing: the selectable grid's Arrow/Space handlers `preventDefault` and its row `mousedown` handler `preventDefault`s to avoid focus-stealing — which swallowed spaces typed into an in-cell editor and stopped in-cell controls taking focus at all, making selection and inline editing mutually exclusive. Both now ignore events originating inside a cell control, so a row can be selected (driving a details pane) AND edited in place. New requirements `must-size-columns-to-widest-cell`, `must-resize-columns-by-drag`, `may-persist-column-widths`, `must-fill-slack-not-stretch`, `must-truncate-when-dragged-narrow`, `must-not-hijack-cell-controls`. |
| 1.3.0 | 2026-09-22 | Mike Fullerton | **Row activation, reordering, and selection checkboxes** (`onRowActivate`, `reorder`, `showSelectionCheckboxes`). Activation: double-click and Enter open a row when handler is provided; reaches keyboard-only users. Reordering: `reorder` prop enables drag-and-drop row reordering with accessible announcements and `canDrag` guards; omit when sorted/filtered. Checkboxes: `showSelectionCheckboxes` adds a leading column with per-row and select-all checkboxes; row labels derive from `describeRow` or row content. New requirements `double-click-activates-row`, `enter-activates-focused-row`, `must-enable-row-drag-to-reorder`, `must-respect-candrag-check`, `must-announce-drag-state`, `must-not-reorder-while-sorted`, `must-add-leading-checkbox-column`, `must-include-select-all`, `must-label-checkboxes`, `checkbox-click-not-select-row`. Platform Notes section added. Deep Linking, Localization, Accessibility Options, Feature Flags, Analytics, Privacy, Logging sections added with not-applicable explanations. |
| 1.3.1 | 2026-09-22 | Mike Fullerton | Platform Notes expanded to five separate bullets (SwiftUI, Compose, AppKit/UIKit, WinUI 3) with concrete guidance on control selection, property mapping, and platform-specific constraints. WinUI 3 bullet specifies DataGrid vs. ItemsRepeater, SelectionMode binding, sorting via SortDescription or built-in, column resize handling, and row reorder patterns. |
| 1.4.0 | 2026-09-22 | Mike Fullerton | Lint pass: corrected the ⌥/Alt-click requirement and its test vector to additive-only selection (source has no ⌘/Ctrl handling); renamed all keyword-prefixed requirements to subject-only kebab-case; added depends-on/related cross-references; added Empty and Loading States requirements; moved the sorted/filtered reorder constraint out of Behavioral Requirements into Design Decisions; reformatted Design Decisions into Decision/Rationale/Approved form and added an SRP-scope decision; rewrote Conformance Test Vectors for full requirement/edge-case coverage and split multi-outcome rows; resolved the in-cell-control contradiction between the last edge case and not-hijack-cell-controls; reworded checkbox-click-not-select-row off the undefined onRowClick API; specified the sort cycle, select-all indeterminate/clear behavior, stale-focused-id, and action-list double-click behaviors; corrected Localization, Accessibility Options, and Platform Notes (React/Web label, SwiftUI Table availability and .insetGrouped, Compose has no dnd-kit equivalent, WinUI 3 DataGrid namespace); added the Compliance table. |
