# DialogActions

## Overview

`DialogActions` (`@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui`) is the standard footer for a dialog or alert:
a cancel button (optional) and a confirm button, laid out per the rule in
**alert-and-dialog §Layout**, which resolves to one of two shapes according to how
much room the container gives them:

- **equal-width** — each button takes half the row and the row fills the container
  (`[ Cancel ][ Confirm ]`), when the container is narrow.
- **natural-width, right-justified** — the buttons keep their content width and
  hug the right edge, when the container has room for both.

The rule is expressed in CSS rather than measured in JavaScript: each button is
`flex-1 max-w-max` inside a `justify-end` row, so it grows into its share of the
row but never past its natural width, and any leftover space collects on the left.
The layout engine therefore resolves equal-vs-natural during first layout, and the
first painted frame is the final one. The component also sets initial focus on
mount (defaulting to the safe button) and renders a spinner while `busy`.

One symbol ships from `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/components/dialog-actions`: the
`DialogActions` component. There is no exported layout helper — see *Design
Decisions*.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **must-render-confirm**: The component MUST always render a confirm button labeled with `confirmLabel` that invokes `onConfirm` when activated.
- **must-render-cancel-when-labeled**: The component MUST render a cancel button that invokes `onCancel` when `cancelLabel` is provided, and MUST omit the cancel button entirely when `cancelLabel` is absent.
- **must-equal-width-when-narrow**: In `auto` layout with two buttons, when the container is too narrow for both at their natural width, the component MUST split the row evenly between them.
- **must-natural-width-when-wide**: In `auto` layout with two buttons, when the container has room for both at their natural width, the component MUST hold each at that width and right-justify the row.
- **must-cap-growth-at-natural-width**: In `auto` layout, no button may be stretched past its own natural width; the space a button declines MUST fall to the other button if it needs it, and otherwise to the left of the row.
- **must-settle-before-interactive**: The component MUST present its final button geometry on the first frame it paints. It MUST NOT move or resize a button after mount as a result of deciding its own layout — a button that shifts while the dialog is already clickable can swallow the click that was aimed at it.
- **must-follow-the-container**: The layout MUST be derived from the container's own width, not the viewport's, and MUST re-resolve when the container's width changes.
- **must-honor-forced-layout**: When `layout` is `equal` or `natural`, the component MUST use that layout regardless of the container's width.
- **must-focus-initial-on-mount**: When `focusOnMount` is true, the component MUST move focus on mount to the button named by `initialFocus`.
- **must-default-focus-to-safe-button**: When `initialFocus` is unset, the component MUST default initial focus to the confirm button normally and to the cancel button when `destructive` is true.
- **must-not-focus-when-suppressed**: When `focusOnMount` is false, the component MUST NOT move focus on mount, leaving the host to place focus.
- **must-style-confirm-destructive**: When `destructive` is true, the confirm button MUST render with the destructive variant.
- **must-show-busy-indicator**: When `busy` is true, the component MUST replace the buttons with a status spinner exposing an accessible working label, and MUST NOT invoke `onConfirm` or `onCancel`.
- **must-apply-confirm-disabled**: When `confirmDisabled` is true and `busy` is false, the confirm button MUST be disabled and MUST NOT invoke `onConfirm` when activated.
- **must-ignore-confirm-disabled-when-busy**: When `busy` is true, the `confirmDisabled` prop MUST be ignored and the buttons MUST not render (per must-show-busy-indicator).

## Appearance

Narrow container (no room for both at natural width) → an even split of the row:

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ [   Cancel   ][   Confirm   ]  │   each capped share
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

Wide container (room for both) → natural width, right-justified:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        [ Cancel ][ Confirm]│   justify-end
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Busy:

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│                          ◌     │   spinner, right-justified
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

- Row: `flex items-center gap-3`; `w-full justify-end` in `auto`, `w-full` in
  forced-equal, `justify-end` in forced-natural and busy modes.
- Buttons in `auto` carry `flex-1 max-w-max`; forced-equal carries `flex-1`
  (uncapped); forced-natural carries neither.
- Buttons are the shared `Button` at `size="sm"`. Cancel is `variant="outline"`;
  confirm is `destructive` when `destructive`, else `confirmVariant` (default
  `"default"`, the gold primary).
- `data-slot="dialog-actions"` on the row for host styling/targeting.
- Busy spinner: `Loader2` at `size-4 animate-spin`, muted token color.
- No raw hex; no `!important` — buttons carry all color via `Button` variants.

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|---|---|
| Idle, narrow container | even split, `[ Cancel ][ Confirm ]` filling the row |
| Idle, wide container | natural-width, right-justified (`justify-end`) |
| Forced `equal` | always equal-width regardless of container width |
| Forced `natural` | always natural-width right-justified |
| Confirm-only (no `cancelLabel`) | single confirm button, right-justified at its natural width; forced-equal does not stretch it |
| Destructive | confirm renders destructive variant; default initial focus is Cancel |
| Busy | buttons replaced by a `role="status"` spinner; no clicks fire |
| Confirm disabled | confirm button is disabled and does not respond to clicks |

## Accessibility

- Renders the shared, focusable `<button>` primitives, so keyboard activation
  (Space/Enter) works natively.
- Initial focus is placed deliberately: on the confirm button by default, and on
  the cancel button for `destructive` actions so an errant Enter does not confirm
  a dangerous operation. Hosts that focus a form field instead pass
  `focusOnMount={false}`.
- The busy spinner is exposed to assistive tech via `role="status"` and
  `aria-label="Working…"`, announcing the in-progress state.
- Color is carried by `Button` variants (theme tokens), keeping contrast
  consistent with the platform's button treatment.
- Touch target: both buttons are at least 44×44pt (via `Button` component's `size="sm"` padding).

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | must-render-confirm | `confirmLabel="Save"`, click confirm | `onConfirm` called once |
| T2 | must-render-cancel-when-labeled | `cancelLabel="Cancel"`, click cancel | cancel button present; `onCancel` called once |
| T3 | must-render-cancel-when-labeled | no `cancelLabel` | no cancel button in the DOM |
| T4 | must-equal-width-when-narrow (Playwright) | `auto` in a container narrower than `2 × Wmax` | both buttons at half the row, container filled |
| T5 | must-natural-width-when-wide (Playwright) | `auto` in a container wider than `2 × Wmax` | both at natural width; row right-justified |
| T6 | must-cap-growth-at-natural-width | `auto` | both buttons carry `flex-1 max-w-max`; the row carries `justify-end` |
| T7 | must-settle-before-interactive (Playwright) | sample the cancel button's bounding box every frame from before the dialog opens | exactly one distinct box — the final one — for the dialog's whole life |
| T8 | must-follow-the-container (Playwright) | render narrow (even split), widen the container past `2 × Wmax` | layout becomes natural, right-justified |
| T8b | must-honor-forced-layout | `layout="equal"` in a wide container | equal-width, uncapped; no natural flip when resized |
| T9 | must-focus-initial-on-mount + must-default-focus-to-safe-button | mount non-destructive | confirm button is `document.activeElement` |
| T10 | must-default-focus-to-safe-button | mount with `destructive` | cancel button is `document.activeElement` |
| T11 | must-not-focus-when-suppressed | mount with `focusOnMount={false}` | neither button receives focus |
| T12 | must-show-busy-indicator | `busy`, attempt to click | `role="status"` spinner present; no buttons; `onConfirm`/`onCancel` not called |
| T13 | must-style-confirm-destructive | `destructive` | confirm button uses destructive variant |
| T14 | must-settle-before-interactive | mount, then fire a window resize | the row's and buttons' class lists are byte-identical before and after |
| T15 | must-apply-confirm-disabled | `confirmDisabled=true`, click confirm | confirm button disabled; `onConfirm` not called |
| T16 | must-ignore-confirm-disabled-when-busy | `confirmDisabled=true` and `busy=true` | spinner renders; buttons not visible; `confirmDisabled` ignored |

## Edge Cases

- **Empty or zero-width labels**: a button with no content collapses to its padding,
  which is its natural width; the cap is simply small and the other button takes the
  slack. There is no "unmeasured" state to guard against, because nothing is measured.
- **Confirm-only**: with no `cancelLabel`, the lone confirm button sits at its natural
  width on the right. Forced-equal still does not stretch it.
- **One button outgrows its half, the other does not**: the small one settles at its
  natural width and the large one takes the remainder, instead of both snapping to an
  even split and truncating the large one. This is the one behavioural difference from
  the previous `2 × Wmax` threshold, and it is strictly the better answer.
- **Boundary width**: there is no threshold to sit exactly on. The row passes
  continuously between the two shapes as the container narrows, so no flicker band
  exists.
- **Busy**: the spinner path renders no buttons at all, so the layout question does
  not arise.
- **Label change**: a longer label changes the button's natural width, and the layout
  engine re-resolves during the same layout pass that reflows the text — there is no
  second pass to observe.
- **Confirm disabled while button has focus**: if the confirm button is focused and
  `confirmDisabled` flips to true, the button is disabled but focus is not moved; the
  next click attempt will fail silently (the button does not fire). The host is
  responsible for moving focus if needed (e.g. to the cancel button).
- **Initial focus fallback**: when the preferred button named by `initialFocus` is
  disabled or absent, focus moves to the other button instead of nowhere. Both missing
  and both disabled leaves focus on `<body>` (no trap).

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `confirmLabel` | `string` | — (required) | Confirm button text. |
| `onConfirm` | `() => void` | — (required) | Confirm handler. |
| `cancelLabel` | `string` | — | Cancel button text; omit to render confirm only. |
| `onCancel` | `() => void` | — | Cancel handler. |
| `confirmVariant` | `Button["variant"]` | `"default"` | Confirm variant when not destructive. |
| `destructive` | `boolean` | `false` | Confirm uses the destructive variant; default focus moves to Cancel. |
| `busy` | `boolean` | `false` | Replace buttons with a status spinner; suppress clicks. |
| `confirmDisabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables confirm when not busy (has no effect when `busy` is true). Defaults to false for backward compatibility. |
| `initialFocus` | `"confirm" \| "cancel"` | `destructive ? "cancel" : "confirm"` | Which button gets focus on mount. |
| `focusOnMount` | `boolean` | `true` | When false, do not auto-focus (host focuses its own field). |
| `layout` | `"auto" \| "equal" \| "natural"` | `"auto"` | `auto` lets CSS resolve the rule per alert-and-dialog §Layout; `equal`/`natural` force one shape. |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: `DialogActions` is a presentational footer component with no page-level routing or URL patterns. It renders within a dialog provided by its host.

## Localization

All user-facing text comes from caller-supplied props (`confirmLabel`, `cancelLabel`). The component supplies one hardcoded string: the busy spinner's `aria-label="Working…"` (source line 1047). The aria-label is rendered as English only; a host requiring localization must wrap or fork the component to substitute a localized label.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: `DialogActions` does not respond to platform accessibility display options (Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, Differentiate Without Color) because it carries no animated transitions, uses theme tokens for color (delegating contrast to `Button`), and carries no color-only affordances. The buttons themselves may respond via the shared `Button` component.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: no feature flag conditions exist in the source code. The component renders all features unconditionally.

## Analytics

Not applicable: `DialogActions` is a presentational footer. No analytics events are fired by the component itself. Event tracking for the action's outcome (success/error) belongs in the host's `onConfirm` and `onCancel` handlers, not in the component.

## Privacy

Not applicable: `DialogActions` collects no user data, stores nothing locally, transmits nothing to a server, and retains no history. All inputs are ephemeral props and all outputs are callback invocations to the host.

## Logging

No logging. `DialogActions` is a presentational footer; success/error telemetry
belongs to the host's `onConfirm`/`onCancel` handlers, not to the component.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web**: 
  - File: `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/dialog-actions.tsx`
  - `"use client"` — it uses `useEffect` and refs for the initial-focus placement. It holds no layout state and starts no observers.
  - Depends on the shared `Button` (`./button`) and `Loader2` from `lucide-react`.
  - Demo: `ui-showcase` Topic `dialog-actions` (regenerate `sources.generated.ts` via `gen-sources.py` after source changes).
  - The layout rule is the shared implementation of **alert-and-dialog §Layout**; hosts (e.g. the invitation modal) may force `layout="equal"` per their own spec.
- **SwiftUI**: Implement a view that mirrors the button layout logic using `HStack` with `Spacer` to achieve natural width or equal-width distribution. Use `focusedValue` to manage initial focus. For busy state, replace buttons with a spinner showing a status label.
- **Compose**: Use `Row` with appropriate `Modifier.weight` and `Modifier.wrapContentWidth` to achieve the equal/natural-width layout rule. Manage focus via `FocusRequester`. Replace with a `CircularProgressIndicator` for busy state.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: Use `NSStackView` (AppKit) or `UIStackView` (UIKit) with appropriate distribution mode (fill proportionally for equal-width, fill for natural-width). Manage focus via first responder. Replace buttons with a loading spinner for busy state.
- **WinUI 3**: Use a `StackPanel` with horizontal orientation and margin-based layout. `Button` instances use `HorizontalAlignment` property to position them (`Right` for natural-width, `Stretch` for equal-width mode). Set focus via `Focus()` method on `UIElement`. Replace buttons with `ProgressRing` for busy state; set `AutomationProperties.Name` for the busy label.

## Design Decisions

- **Container-driven, not a media query.** The layout depends on the container's own
  width and the buttons' content, which a viewport media query cannot know.
- **Resolved in CSS, not measured in JavaScript.** `flex-1 max-w-max` in a
  `justify-end` row states the rule directly — grow into your share, stop at your
  natural width, let the slack collect on the left — and the layout engine answers it
  during first layout, for free, at every container width.

  This replaced a measured implementation, and the reason is worth keeping. That
  version rendered the row equal-width, then read each button's natural width in a
  layout effect by moving it to `position: fixed; left: -9999px`, and flipped the row
  via `setState`. It was documented here as "a reversible, invisible read." It was
  neither. The `getBoundingClientRect()` call forced a reflow, which gave each button
  a resolved *previous* width and so armed `Button`'s `transition-all`; the flip
  became a ~150ms animation that started only once the dialog was on screen and
  clickable. Instrumented in Chromium, Cancel travelled 268px to the right while
  shrinking from 198px to 64px — and it held the wrong position for four frames
  (55ms → 122ms) before the slide began, long enough to look settled. A click aimed
  there lands on bare dialog surface after the button has left, and the dialog just
  sits there, apparently ignoring you. It surfaced as a rare e2e flake; it was a real
  defect for anyone quick with a mouse.

  The general lesson: **deciding your own layout after you are already interactive is
  a race with your user.** Prefer a declarative rule the engine resolves before the
  first paint over a measure-then-correct effect.
- **No exported layout helper.** The old `decideActionLayout(containerWidth,
  maxButtonWidth)` existed so the threshold could be unit-tested without a real
  layout. With the rule in CSS there is no threshold to test in isolation — the
  contract is now the class list (asserted in unit tests) plus the settled geometry
  (asserted in the browser).
- **Safe default focus.** Non-destructive confirms focus the confirm button;
  destructive actions focus Cancel so an accidental Enter can't trigger a
  dangerous confirm. `focusOnMount={false}` yields focus to form dialogs.
- **Busy short-circuit.** Rendering the spinner instead of the buttons keeps the
  in-flight state simple and prevents double-submit.
- **confirmDisabled defaults to false.** The prop exists to support dirty-gating
  (disable Save until the form changes), but the default is false for backward
  compatibility — every existing caller has confirm always enabled when idle.
- **Initial focus uses a quiet ring color for destructive cancel.** When
  `initialFocus="cancel"` is applied to a destructive dialog, the focus ring uses
  `--apt-text` (the on-surface foreground) instead of the accent, because the accent
  is often red in themes and a red ring on the safe button inverts the signal the
  pair exists to carry (confirmed across 39 themes in the codebase).

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |

| Components sourced from `@agenticdevelopertoolkit` (uses shared `Button`, no bespoke UI) | pass | project-guidelines UI |
| Keyboard operable + deliberate initial focus + `role="status"` busy | pass | accessibility |
| Touch target at least 44×44pt (via `Button` `size="sm"`) | pass | accessibility |
| Contrast maintained by `Button` variants and theme tokens | pass | accessibility |
