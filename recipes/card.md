# Card

## Overview

`Card` groups related content inside a single visually-bounded container.

The UI Card family (`packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/card.tsx`) is a compound, slot-based family of six independently composable components (`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`), each a styled `<div>` that forwards `className` and other props. The UI `Card` itself imposes no required child structure — callers assemble whichever slots they need.

## Behavioral Requirements

UI Card family (`packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/card.tsx`):

- **export-six-slot-components**: The UI Card family MUST export exactly six components: `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`.
- **render-div-root**: Each of the six UI Card family components MUST render a `div` as its root element.
- **set-data-slot-attribute**: Each of the six UI Card family components MUST set a `data-slot` attribute on its root element identifying its role (`card`, `card-header`, `card-title`, `card-description`, `card-content`, `card-footer`, respectively).
- **merge-classname-prop**: Each of the six UI Card family components MUST merge a caller-supplied `className` prop with its own default class list via the `cn` utility, rather than discarding either.
- **forward-rest-props**: Each of the six UI Card family components MUST spread all other received props onto its rendered root `div` element.
- **compose-any-slot-subset**: Consumers MAY include any subset and ordering of `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter` inside `Card`, since `Card` itself renders only the props (including `children`) it receives, without requiring any specific slot structure.
- **always-renders-default-div**: The UI Card family MUST render its default-classed `<div>` regardless of whether children are supplied, per the unconditional `{...props}`/`children` spread in each component.
- **card-corner-radius**: The `Card` root MUST use the `rounded-xl` Tailwind utility for its corner radius; no sub-slot sets its own corner radius.
- **card-vertical-padding**: The `Card` root MUST use vertical padding `py-6` and sets no horizontal padding of its own.
- **slot-horizontal-padding**: `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter` MUST each add horizontal padding `px-6`.
- **card-children-gap**: `Card` MUST use `gap-6` between its top-level children.
- **header-children-gap**: `CardHeader` MUST use `gap-1.5` between its own children.
- **title-font-weight**: `CardTitle` MUST use `font-semibold` with `leading-none`.
- **description-font-size**: `CardDescription` MUST use `text-sm`.
- **card-background**: The `Card` root MUST use the `bg-apt-bg` token.
- **card-text-color**: `Card` and `CardTitle` MUST use the `text-apt-text` token.
- **description-text-color**: `CardDescription` MUST use `text-apt-text-muted`.
- **card-border**: The `Card` root MUST use `border` (the Tailwind default 1px width) with the `border-apt-border` color token.
- **card-shadow**: The `Card` root MUST use `shadow-sm`.

## Appearance

The UI Card family expresses appearance by class name rather than by literal value, and the class name is the requirement — it names Tailwind utilities and `apt-*` design tokens inline.

- **Corner radius** (#requirements/card-corner-radius):
  - UI Card family: the `Card` root uses the `rounded-xl` Tailwind utility; no sub-slot sets its own corner radius.
- **Padding** (#requirements/card-vertical-padding, #requirements/slot-horizontal-padding, #requirements/card-children-gap, #requirements/header-children-gap):
  - UI Card family: the `Card` root uses vertical padding `py-6` and sets no horizontal padding of its own; `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter` each add horizontal padding `px-6`. `Card` uses `gap-6` between its top-level children and `CardHeader` uses `gap-1.5` between its own children.
- **Font** (#requirements/title-font-weight, #requirements/description-font-size):
  - UI Card family: `CardTitle` uses `font-semibold` with `leading-none`; `CardDescription` uses `text-sm`. `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter` set no font utility and inherit from their ancestor. No literal point size appears in the source; the Tailwind scale step is the specification.
- **Background** (#requirements/card-background):
  - UI Card family: the `Card` root uses the `bg-apt-bg` token; no sub-slot sets a background.
- **Foreground/Text** (#requirements/card-text-color, #requirements/description-text-color):
  - UI Card family: `Card` and `CardTitle` use the `text-apt-text` token; `CardDescription` uses `text-apt-text-muted`. `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter` set no text color and inherit `text-apt-text` from the `Card` root.
- **Border** (#requirements/card-border):
  - UI Card family: the `Card` root uses `border` (the Tailwind default 1px width) with the `border-apt-border` color token; no sub-slot has its own border.
- **Shadow** (#requirements/card-shadow):
  - UI Card family: the `Card` root uses `shadow-sm`; no sub-slot has its own shadow.
- **Min/Max size**: The UI Card family does not constrain width or height: the `Card` sets no sizing utility, so it fills the inline size its parent gives it and sizes to its content in the block direction.

## States

Not applicable: Card is a static, non-interactive container and does not define any interactive states beyond the default render state.

## Accessibility

- **Role/trait**: The UI Card family sets no explicit ARIA `role`. It renders a plain `<div>` (`<div data-slot="card" ...>`), which carries no implicit interactive role — it is a generic, non-interactive container.
- **Label requirements**: The UI Card family's `CardTitle` renders a plain `<div data-slot="card-title">` with no heading semantics, and the source sets no `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, or a grouping role on the container. NEEDS REVIEW: what is missing is a decision on whether a titled content container built from the UI Card family must expose its title as a heading or as the accessible name of a labelled group — the source cannot settle this, because the family deliberately leaves element semantics to the caller. Evidence that would settle it: a WCAG 2.1 AA audit of a rendered page using the family against SC 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and SC 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels), plus confirmation from the design owner of which slot is intended to carry the accessible name.
- **Announce state changes**: Not applicable: Card has no interactive states to announce.
- **Minimum tap target**: Not applicable: Card is not an interactive element — no `onClick`/`onPress` handler exists.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| card-001 | [export-six-slot-components](#requirements/export-six-slot-components) | `import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter }` (UI Card family) | All six imports resolve to defined function exports. |
| card-002 | [render-div-root](#requirements/render-div-root) | Render each of the six UI Card family components with no props | Each renders a `<div>` as its outermost node. |
| card-003 | [set-data-slot-attribute](#requirements/set-data-slot-attribute) | Render `<Card />`, `<CardHeader />`, `<CardTitle />`, `<CardDescription />`, `<CardContent />`, `<CardFooter />` | Each rendered root `div` carries its matching `data-slot` value (`card`, `card-header`, `card-title`, `card-description`, `card-content`, `card-footer`). |
| card-004 | [merge-classname-prop](#requirements/merge-classname-prop) | `<Card className="extra-class" />` | The rendered root `div`'s `class` attribute contains both `extra-class` and the component's default classes (e.g. `rounded-xl`). |
| card-005 | [forward-rest-props](#requirements/forward-rest-props) | `<Card data-testid="x" />` | The rendered root `div` carries `data-testid="x"`. |
| card-006 | [compose-any-slot-subset](#requirements/compose-any-slot-subset) | `<Card><CardContent>Only content</CardContent></Card>` (Header/Title/Description/Footer omitted) | Renders without error, containing only the `CardContent` slot's markup. |
| card-007 | [always-renders-default-div](#requirements/always-renders-default-div) | `<Card />` (UI Card family, no children) | Renders an empty `<div data-slot="card">` carrying its default classes; nothing in source prevents an empty card. |

| card-022 | [card-shadow](#requirements/card-shadow) | `<Card />` | The rendered root `div`'s `class` attribute contains `shadow-sm`. |

## Edge Cases

- **Null/empty input — UI Card family**: No component performs prop validation. `Card` rendered with no children renders an empty `<div>` with its default classes — nothing in source prevents an empty card (#requirements/always-renders-default-div), per the unconditional `{...props}`/`children` spread in each component.
- **Boundary values**: Not applicable: The source exposes no numeric/length-constrained input (no min/max props, no character limits).
- **Concurrent access**: Not applicable: The UI Card family components are stateless, pure render functions with no internal state and no shared mutable resource; there is nothing to serialize.
- **Error states**: Not applicable: Card is a presentational container with no error-handling responsibility; errors would originate from child content, not the container itself.
- **Offline/disconnected state**: Not applicable: The source performs no network request; all six components are purely local rendering functions.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `className` | `string` | `undefined` | UI Card family (all six components). Additional classes merged with each component's default classes via `cn`. |
| *(rest props)* | native `div` attributes | none | UI Card family (all six components). Any other native `div` attribute is forwarded to the root element via prop spreading. |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: Card is a layout primitive, not a navigable screen or route target.

## Localization

Not applicable: the UI Card family defines no built-in copy or default string. All visible text (the slot content passed into the family) is fully supplied by the caller as props/children. There is no string key defined anywhere in the source file.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable as a behavior the component implements: the source does not branch on an accessibility display option. The table records what each option therefore means for this component.

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Reduce Motion | No transition or animation is applied in the source; nothing to disable under Reduce Motion. |
| Increase Contrast | No high-contrast variant is defined. Contrast comes from whatever the `apt-*` tokens resolve to for the active theme; the components themselves do not branch on the setting. |
| Differentiate Without Color | The card conveys no information by color: structure is carried by the border and the slot layout, so there is no color-only distinction to differentiate. |

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: Card renders unconditionally; the source does not read or gate a feature flag.

## Analytics

Not applicable: Card is a presentational container and does not emit analytics events. Event tracking, if needed, is the responsibility of content or parent components that consume the card.

## Privacy

- **Data collected**: None. The source file collects, stores, or transmits no data; it is purely presentational and receives all content via props/children.
- **Storage**: Not applicable — the source contains no storage code.
- **Transmission**: Not applicable — the source performs no network request.
- **Retention**: Not applicable — no data is collected or stored.

## Logging

Not applicable: Card does not perform logging; it is a presentational component with no internal state or event lifecycle to track.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: No native `Card` primitive exists; compose a `VStack` (`HStack` for a footer-like row) inside a container view, applying `.background()`, `.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius:))`, `.overlay(RoundedRectangle().stroke())`, and `.shadow()` to reproduce the UI Card family's `bg-apt-bg`/`rounded-xl`/`border-apt-border`/`shadow-sm`. Map `CardHeader`/`CardTitle`/`CardDescription`/`CardContent`/`CardFooter` to nested `VStack`/`Text` views, using `VStack(spacing:)` for the `gap-6`/`gap-1.5` rhythm and `.padding(.horizontal)`/`.padding(.vertical)` for the `px-6`/`py-6` split, since SwiftUI has no `data-slot`-style attribute mechanism. Add `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)` with `.accessibilityLabel()` on the container and `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)` on the title to supply the group and heading semantics the web source leaves unset.
- **Compose**: Use Material 3's `androidx.compose.material3.Card` as the base container, configuring its `shape`, `colors`, `border`, and `elevation` parameters to match `rounded-xl`/`bg-apt-bg`/`border-apt-border`/`shadow-sm`; note that M3's default `Card` is filled and elevated, so an outlined, near-flat look needs `OutlinedCard` or an explicit `CardDefaults.cardElevation`. Nest `Column`/`Row` composables for the header/content/footer slots, using `Arrangement.spacedBy()` for `gap-6`/`gap-1.5` and `Modifier.padding()` for `px-6`/`py-6`. Use `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true)` plus `heading()` on the title composable to recover the semantics the source's plain `div` does not carry.
- **React/Web**: This is the source platform; implement as given — the UI Card family as the six `cn`-composed Tailwind `div` components shown in source.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: No native card container exists. Compose an `NSView` (an `NSBox`, or a plain `NSView` with `wantsLayer = true`) or a `UIView`, setting `layer.cornerRadius` with `layer.masksToBounds`, `layer.borderWidth`/`layer.borderColor`, and `layer.shadowOpacity`/`shadowRadius`/`shadowOffset` to reproduce corner radius, border, and shadow — note that a single layer cannot both mask and cast a shadow, so use a wrapper view for the shadow and an inner masked view for the rounded fill. Lay the header/title/description/content/footer out as an `NSStackView`/`UIStackView`, with `spacing` standing in for `gap-6`/`gap-1.5` and `layoutMargins` for `px-6`/`py-6`, since neither framework has a `data-slot` equivalent. Set `isAccessibilityElement = false` on the container and `accessibilityTraits = .header` on the title label to recover the `<h3>` semantics.
- **WinUI 3**: Use a `Border` wrapping a `StackPanel` (or `Grid`) as the root, setting `CornerRadius`, `BorderBrush`/`BorderThickness`, and `Background` to the theme resources standing in for `rounded-xl`/`border-apt-border`/`bg-apt-bg`, and apply a `ThemeShadow` through the root element's `Shadow` and `Translation` properties to approximate `shadow-sm`. Nest `StackPanel`s for the header, content, and footer slots, with the footer panel using `Orientation="Horizontal"` and `VerticalAlignment="Center"` to match the source's `flex items-center`. WinUI 3 has no flexbox `gap`, so reproduce `gap-6`/`gap-1.5` with `StackPanel.Spacing` (or an explicit `Margin` on each child inside a `Grid`), and express the source's `py-6`/`px-6` split as `Padding` on the root `Border` for the vertical axis plus `Padding` on each slot panel for the horizontal axis. There is no `data-slot` equivalent: give each slot an `x:Name`, or define the whole card as a templated `ContentControl` whose `ControlTemplate` exposes `Header`, `Content`, and `Footer` `ContentPresenter`s. The card is non-interactive, so set `IsTabStop="False"` and define no `VisualStateManager` states for pointer, press, or focus; set `AutomationProperties.Name` on the root and `AutomationProperties.HeadingLevel="Level3"` on the title `TextBlock` to supply heading semantics the source does not set.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: State the Tailwind utility classes and `apt-*` design tokens themselves as the Appearance requirement, rather than resolving them to literal pixel or color values.
**Rationale**: The UI Card family expresses every color and size as a Tailwind utility class or an `apt-*` design token (e.g. `bg-apt-bg`, `border-apt-border`, `text-apt-text-muted`) rather than as a literal value. `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/card.tsx:5-6` states the intent directly: "The family Card — mirrors hub's component (apt-* tokens, generous 6-unit rhythm) so the shared library and hub render identically." The token indirection is load-bearing and MUST NOT be flattened into hard-coded values; an implementation conforms by using the named token, and the concrete pixel or color value is whatever the project's Tailwind and token configuration binds to it.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Document no invented accessibility behavior beyond what the source sets.
**Rationale**: The UI Card family sets no ARIA role, label association, or tap target, because it is not an interactive control in source — it is a static container. This ingredient does not invent accessibility behavior that is not present in the code (see Accessibility).
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [semantic-markup](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#semantic-markup) | partial | Accessibility |
| [contrast-ratio](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#contrast-ratio) | partial | Accessibility |
| [dynamic-type-support](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#dynamic-type-support) | partial | Accessibility |
| [no-hardcoded-strings](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/internationalization#no-hardcoded-strings) | passed | Internationalization |

The source sets no explicit ARIA role or heading semantics for the UI Card family's `CardTitle` (semantic-markup: partial, pending the open Accessibility decision), and expresses color and type only as unresolved `apt-*` tokens or Tailwind classes whose rendered contrast and text scaling cannot be confirmed from source alone (contrast-ratio, dynamic-type-support: partial); the source file defines no single string literal, so all visible text passes through as caller-supplied props/children (no-hardcoded-strings: passed).
