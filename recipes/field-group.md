# FieldGroup

## Overview

The shared `FieldGroup` in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui` — the standard sectioning wrapper for
settings and editor forms. It is a bordered card with an uppercase-mono title row
across the top and its `Field` children stacked below, so a settings pane reads as a
series of titled groups instead of a flat wall of inputs.

The title row also carries an optional `trailing` accessory pinned to its right
edge — a status line ("Saved"), a small action (a "Reset" button), or a badge —
that belongs to the group as a whole rather than to any one field.

`FieldGroup` is presentation-only: it owns no form state and imposes no field type.
It composes the shared `Field` (`agenticdeveloperhub://recipes/field`) as its
expected children and reuses the same `fieldCaptionClass` caption treatment as the
field caption, so the group title and the field captions share one visual language.

## Ingredients

| Name | Domain | Role | Required | Configuration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Field | agenticdeveloperhub://recipes/field | The grouped rows — each caption+control+hint/error that the group stacks | yes | Passed as `children`; the group applies `gap-3` between them |

The group title reuses the shared `fieldCaptionClass` from `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/lib/typography`
(the same uppercase-mono caption treatment `Field` uses), so titles and field
captions stay visually identical. `trailing` is an arbitrary caller node
(status text, a `Button`, a badge) — not a fixed ingredient.

## Integration Requirements

- **must-render-title**: The group MUST render the `title` node as an uppercase-mono
  heading (the shared `fieldCaptionClass`) in the top row.
- **must-render-title-as-heading**: The group MUST render the `title` inside an
  `<h3>` so the section is a real heading in the document outline.
- **must-render-trailing-when-set**: When `trailing` is provided, the group MUST
  render it in the title row, right-aligned opposite the title; when unset, the
  title row MUST show the title alone.
- **must-stack-children**: The group MUST render its `children` (the Fields) as a
  vertical stack below the title row, with consistent spacing between rows.
- **must-be-bordered-card**: The group MUST present as a bordered, rounded surface
  (`apt-border` / `apt-surface` tokens) that visually contains its title and fields.
- **must-merge-classname**: The group MUST merge a caller-supplied `className` onto
  its root `section` without dropping its own layout classes.

## Layout

```
┌ section (rounded, bordered, recessed surface) ─────────────────┐
│  GROUP TITLE                              [ trailing accessory ]│  ← title row
│                                                                 │
│  ┌ Field ───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ CAPTION / control / hint|error                            │ │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│  ┌ Field ───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ CAPTION / control / hint|error                            │ │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Root: `section` — `flex flex-col gap-3 rounded-lg border border-apt-border
  bg-apt-surface-2/40 p-3` (recessed card).
- Title row: `flex items-center justify-between gap-2`; the `<h3>` title on the
  `fieldCaptionClass`, the `trailing` node right-aligned via `justify-between`.
- Children: the `Field` rows follow the title row in the same column, separated by
  the section's `gap-3`.
- No raw hex; no `!important`; every color is an `apt-*` token.

## Shared State

| State | Source | Consumer | Direction | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | Caller | Group heading (`<h3>`) | Down | Prop |
| `trailing` | Caller | Title-row accessory slot | Down | Prop (optional) |
| `children` (Fields) | Caller | Stacked group body | Down | Prop |
| Field values / validation | Owning form (outside the group) | The `Field` controls | — | Not owned by `FieldGroup` — it is pure layout |

`FieldGroup` holds no state of its own; it is a stateless layout wrapper, so all
form state flows through the `Field` controls the caller nests, not through the
group.

## Integration Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | must-render-title, must-render-title-as-heading | `title="Profile"` | An `<h3>` with uppercase-mono "Profile" renders in the top row |
| T2 | must-render-trailing-when-set | `trailing={<Button>Reset</Button>}` | The Reset button renders right-aligned in the title row, opposite the title |
| T3 | must-render-trailing-when-set | `trailing` omitted | The title row shows the title alone; no trailing slot content |
| T4 | must-stack-children | two `Field` children | Both Fields render stacked below the title row with the group's `gap-3` |
| T5 | must-be-bordered-card | any props | The root `section` has the bordered rounded recessed-surface treatment |
| T6 | must-merge-classname | `className="mt-6"` | Root keeps `flex flex-col … border …` and adds `mt-6` |

## Edge Cases

- No `trailing` → the title row still lays out with `justify-between`, so the title
  sits at the left edge exactly as with an accessory present.
- Zero `children` → an empty titled card renders (title row only); the group does
  not error on an empty body.
- A `trailing` node wider than its slot shares the row via `gap-2`; the title
  (`h3`) does not truncate here — long titles wrap unless the caller constrains them.
- `children` need not be `Field`s specifically — any nodes stack — but the group is
  designed and spaced for `Field` rows.
- `title` is a `ReactNode`, so an inline glyph/badge in the title still renders with
  the caption treatment.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: Not applicable — FieldGroup is a web-only layout component with no native SwiftUI equivalent. On Apple platforms, implement the titled card pattern using native SwiftUI views (VStack with header).
- **Compose**: Not applicable — FieldGroup is a web-only layout component. On Android, use Compose's native Column layout with a header composable as the sectioning wrapper.
- **React/Web**: Implemented in `packages/web/packages/ui/src/blocks/field-group.tsx`, exported via `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks/field-group`. The component carries `"use client"` (ships alongside interactive form content) and composes `Field` (`agenticdeveloperhub://recipes/field`) as its children plus the shared `fieldCaptionClass` for the title. Used platform-wide as the sectioning wrapper in settings/editor panes; commonly the last group in such a pane is a destructive "danger zone" section. Verify responsive behavior via Playwright (ui-showcase) at 375 / 768 / 1440 — the title/trailing row and the stacked Fields stay usable on mobile.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: Not applicable — FieldGroup is a web-only layout component. On iOS/macOS, implement the titled card pattern using native UIView/NSView containers with a header label.
- **WinUI 3**: Use a vertical `StackPanel` with `Spacing="3"` as the root container. Apply `Padding="12"`, `BorderThickness="1"` bound to the border token, `CornerRadius="8"`, and `Background` to the surface token for the recessed card effect. Nest a horizontal `StackPanel` in the title row with `HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"`, containing a `TextBlock` header (uppercase letter-spacing to match the web `fieldCaptionClass`) and an optional trailing `UIElement` aligned right via `HorizontalAlignment="Right"`. Below the title row, add a vertical `StackPanel` for the grouped field rows, inheriting the parent's `Spacing` for consistent gaps. No interactive states required — the component is a stateless layout wrapper.

API (`@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks/field-group`):

```ts
interface FieldGroupProps {
  title: React.ReactNode
  trailing?: React.ReactNode   // right-aligned accessory in the title row
  children: React.ReactNode    // the grouped Fields
  className?: string
}
export function FieldGroup(props: FieldGroupProps): React.ReactElement
```

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: The title reuses `fieldCaptionClass` (the same treatment as `Field`
  captions) inside an `<h3>`. **Rationale**: Group titles and field captions read as
  one caption language, and the heading gives the section real document-outline
  structure for AT.
- **Decision**: `trailing` is a single right-aligned slot rather than a fixed
  actions API. **Rationale**: Keeps the group a generic wrapper (status, a button,
  or a badge) and optimizes-for-change by not baking a specific accessory contract
  into the group.
- **Decision**: The group owns no form state. **Rationale**: It stays a pure layout
  composition over `Field`; value and validation policy live in the owning form,
  keeping the group reusable across every settings pane.
- **Decision**: Recessed `apt-surface-2/40` card on `apt-border`. **Rationale**: The
  group reads as a contained section against the pane background without a heavy
  border or any color literal.
