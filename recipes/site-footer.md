# Site Footer

## Overview

The Site Footer is a structural footer component that renders a semantic HTML `<footer>` landmark element containing page footer content. It applies a fixed CSS class and optional custom classes, and wraps its content in a layout column (Wrap) to constrain width and maintain consistency with other page sections. Unlike Band and Wrap, the footer owns its own visual chrome directly — background, text color, font size, and a top hairline border all live on `.lp-site-foot` itself. It reserves space for the dock clearance like other band components and is positioned as the last element beneath the dock.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-footer-landmark**: Component MUST render an HTML `<footer>` element.
- **apply-lp-site-foot-class**: Component MUST apply the CSS class `lp-site-foot` to the footer element.
- **accept-children**: Component MUST accept and render ReactNode children.
- **wrap-children-in-layout-column**: Component MUST wrap children in a Wrap component to provide constrained layout.
- **accept-custom-class**: Component MAY accept an optional `className` prop to apply additional CSS classes.
- **merge-classes**: When a custom `className` is provided, component MUST apply both `lp-site-foot` and the custom class name to the footer element, separated by a space, and MUST filter out falsy values (`className={undefined}`, `className={false}`, or `className=""`); it does not trim whitespace-only strings and performs no de-duplication.
- **apply-footer-chrome**: Component's stylesheet (`.lp-site-foot`) MUST set its own vertical padding (`clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem)` top; the same value plus `var(--lp-dock-clear, 0px)` on the bottom), a `1px` top hairline border, a `var(--lp-ground)` background, `var(--lp-ink-dim)` text color, and a `0.86rem` font size — none of this is inherited from `Wrap` or from descendants.
- **style-descendant-links**: Component's stylesheet MUST style descendant `<a>` elements (`.lp-site-foot a`) with a non-default link color (`var(--lp-ink)`), no text-decoration underline, and a hairline bottom border, plus a hover state that swaps the border color to `var(--lp-accent)`, so a host's footer links never fall back to the browser's default blue underline against the dark ground.
- **style-credit-sub-lines**: Component's stylesheet MUST style descendant `<small>` elements (`.lp-site-foot small`) with a reduced font size (`0.72rem`) and letter-spacing (`0.04em`), for copyright or attribution sub-lines within a credit line.

## Appearance

- **Corner radius**: None
- **Padding**: `clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem)` top; the same clamp value plus `var(--lp-dock-clear, 0px)` on the bottom. Set directly by `.lp-site-foot` in `flow.css` — not inherited from `Wrap` or from descendants (see **apply-footer-chrome**).
- **Font**: `0.86rem`, set by `.lp-site-foot` itself; not inherited.
- **Background**: `var(--lp-ground, #101010)`, set by `.lp-site-foot` itself — the component does not leave background to its children.
- **Foreground/Text**: `var(--lp-ink-dim, #a0a0a0)`, set by `.lp-site-foot` itself. Descendant links override to `var(--lp-ink, #ededed)` via `.lp-site-foot a` (see **style-descendant-links**).
- **Border**: `1px solid var(--lp-hairline, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1))` top hairline, set by `.lp-site-foot` itself.
- **Shadow**: None applied by component
- **Min/Max size**: Full width; constrained content width via the `Wrap` component, which handles horizontal centering and max measure only — it does not contribute the padding, background, border, color, or font described above.

## States

Not applicable: component is stateless and does not render interactive or state-dependent content.

## Accessibility

- **Role**: Landmark (`<footer>` renders the implicit `contentinfo` role)
- **Landmark exposure**: The `<footer>` element only exposes the `contentinfo` landmark role when it is NOT nested inside `article`, `section`, `main`, `aside`, or `nav`. A host MUST render `SiteFooter` as a direct, page-level child (a sibling of the page's bands, not nested within one) for the landmark to reach assistive technology; the component itself renders only the element and does not enforce where it is mounted.
- **Label requirements**: No explicit ARIA labeling required; a page normally has one `<footer>` landmark, so no accessible name is needed to disambiguate it.
- **Keyboard navigation**: Not applicable; the component itself renders no interactive elements — see **style-descendant-links** for the descendant links it styles but does not create.
- **Touch target size**: Not applicable; component is a container, not an interactive control.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| site-footer-001 | render-footer-landmark | Render component with no props | Output contains a `<footer>` element |
| site-footer-002 | apply-lp-site-foot-class | Render component with no props | Footer element's `class` attribute contains `lp-site-foot` |
| site-footer-003 | accept-children | Render with `children="Footer content"` | Footer element contains text "Footer content" |
| site-footer-004 | wrap-children-in-layout-column | Render with children | Footer's direct child is a `<div>` with class `lp-wrap`, and that `div` contains the children |
| site-footer-005 | merge-classes | Render with `className="custom-footer"` | Footer element's `class` attribute is exactly `lp-site-foot custom-footer` |
| site-footer-006 | merge-classes | Render with `className={undefined}` | Footer element's `class` attribute is exactly `lp-site-foot` |
| site-footer-007 | merge-classes | Render with `className=""` | Footer element's `class` attribute is exactly `lp-site-foot` (empty string is falsy and filtered) |
| site-footer-008 | apply-footer-chrome | Render component | Footer element's computed style has a `1px` top border, `background-color` equal to the `--lp-ground` token, `color` equal to the `--lp-ink-dim` token, and `font-size: 0.86rem` |
| site-footer-009 | apply-footer-chrome | Render component with `--lp-dock-clear` set to a non-zero value on an ancestor | Footer element's computed `padding-bottom` equals `clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem)` plus the `--lp-dock-clear` value |
| site-footer-010 | style-descendant-links | Render with `children={<a href="#">Credit</a>}` | Descendant `<a>` element's computed style has no underline text-decoration, a `1px` bottom border, and `color` equal to the `--lp-ink` token |
| site-footer-011 | style-credit-sub-lines | Render with `children={<small>© 2026</small>}` | Descendant `<small>` element's computed `font-size` is `0.72rem` |

## Edge Cases

- **Empty children**: Component MUST render a valid `<footer>` element even when children are empty or null.
- **Null className**: When `className` is `undefined` or not provided, component MUST apply only the `lp-site-foot` class; the `undefined` value is filtered out because it is falsy.
- **Whitespace-only className**: An empty string (`''`) is falsy, so it is filtered out, leaving only `lp-site-foot`. A whitespace-only string (e.g. `' '`) is truthy in JavaScript, so it is NOT filtered — it is joined into the class list as-is. The component only filters falsy values; it does not trim or validate whitespace, and performs no de-duplication.

## Configuration

Not applicable: component accepts only React props `children` and optional `className`; no configuration options exist.

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: component is a layout container and does not handle routing or deep link resolution.

## Localization

Not applicable: component renders no user-facing text; all content is provided by children.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: component has no interactive states or visual styling that would respond to accessibility display options such as Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, or Differentiate Without Color.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: component has no conditional rendering or feature-gated behavior.

## Analytics

Not applicable: component is non-interactive and does not emit user interaction events.

## Privacy

Not applicable: component does not collect, store, or transmit any data.

## Logging

Not applicable: component has no internal operations, async behavior, or error states that would require logging.

## Platform Notes

- **Source (TypeScript/React)**: Implemented in `packages/web/packages/landing/src/flow/SiteFooter.tsx`. Accepts `children` (ReactNode, required) and `className` (string, optional). Returns JSX rendering an HTML `<footer>` element with merged class names and Wrap-wrapped children. The `lp-site-foot` class is the fixed style hook; custom classes are composed via `['lp-site-foot', className].filter(Boolean).join(' ')`. All visual chrome (padding, dock clearance, background, border, color, font size, and the descendant link/small styling) lives in `flow.css` on `.lp-site-foot` and its descendant selectors, not in the component itself.

- **SwiftUI**: Implement as a `View` that renders a full-width container with an inner content stack constrained to the same max-width measure used by the `Wrap` port, and apply the container's own background, foreground color, font, and top hairline divider directly (mirroring `.lp-site-foot`, not delegating them to the content column). Add bottom padding equal to the host's dock-clearance inset (an environment value or parameter the host supplies). There is no `.footer` accessibility trait or built-in `SiteFooterStyle` modifier to reach for; use a plain container View and rely on the platform mapping a suitably placed container to the "content info" accessibility landmark, or a dedicated accessibility container element if the platform version supports one.

- **Compose**: On Android, implement a footer as a Composable that uses `Box` or `Column` with `Modifier.fillMaxWidth()` to span the full width, its own background/content color/typography applied directly (not inherited), and internal padding — including a bottom inset bound to the dock-clearance value — to reserve dock clearance. The content parameter accepts a `@Composable` lambda to render arbitrary children within a max-width content column matching `Wrap`.

- **AppKit / UIKit**: Implement the footer as the LAST arranged subview of the scrolling content (an arranged subview at the end of a `UIStackView`/`NSStackView` inside the scroll view), not as a view pinned to the screen's safe area — pinning it there would make it fixed, but the source footer scrolls with the page and is simply the final thing in it. Give the footer's own layer/background, text color, font, and top hairline border directly, and add bottom spacing equal to the dock clearance so a fixed dock never permanently covers it. Constrain an inner content view to the same max width as the `Wrap` port.

- **WinUI 3**: Implement as a `Grid` row (or `StackPanel`) spanning the full width of the page's root layout, with its own `Background`, `Foreground`, `FontSize`, and a `BorderThickness`/`BorderBrush` top hairline set directly on that row — not inherited from the content column. Wrap content in an inner `Grid`/`Border` with `MaxWidth` bound to the same measure token used by the `Wrap` port. Bind the row's bottom `Padding` to a dock-clearance resource (the WinUI equivalent of `--lp-dock-clear`) so content is not covered by a docked control at the bottom of the window. Apply no `CornerRadius`, matching Appearance's "Corner radius: None".

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: `.lp-site-foot` sets its own background, foreground color, font size, top border, and padding — including dock clearance — directly, rather than delegating any of it to `Wrap` or inheriting it from descendants.
**Rationale**: `Wrap` only constrains content width (see `wrap.md`); the footer needs a full-width band of chrome (ground color, hairline, dimmed ink) independent of that content column, matching the visual treatment of the rest of the page's bands.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Dock clearance (`var(--lp-dock-clear)`) is added to `.lp-site-foot`'s own bottom padding, not to `.lp-band:last-child`'s, on a page that has a footer.
**Rationale**: `flow.css`'s comment above `.lp-band:last-child` explains that only the last thing in the document — the one thing a fixed host dock can permanently cover, since everything before it can still be scrolled past — needs the clearance. On a host with a footer, the footer is that last thing, not the band before it; paying the clearance on both would double the wasted scroll space.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The component composes `Wrap` non-configurably to constrain content width, the same pattern `Band` uses.
**Rationale**: Keeps horizontal measure consistent with the rest of the page's structural blocks without giving a caller a way to opt out per instance.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: `className` merging filters only falsy values (`Boolean` truthiness) and performs no trimming or de-duplication.
**Rationale**: `['lp-site-foot', className].filter(Boolean).join(' ')` is the entire implementation; documenting exactly that behavior — including the whitespace-only string case it does not handle — keeps the contract honest rather than promising validation the source does not do.
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [semantic-markup](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#semantic-markup) | passed | Accessibility |
| [contrast-ratio](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#contrast-ratio) | partial | Accessibility |

`semantic-markup` passes because the component always renders a real `<footer>` element, which carries the correct implicit `contentinfo` landmark role when placed as a direct page-level child (see **Accessibility**). `contrast-ratio` is partial because `flow.css` pairs `--lp-ground`/`--lp-ink-dim` for the footer body and `--lp-ink`/`--lp-ground` for its links (see **Appearance**), but the actual rendered contrast depends on whichever values a host supplies for those custom properties, which the source neither computes nor verifies.
