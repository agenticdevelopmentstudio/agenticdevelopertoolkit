# Stepper

## Overview

A stepper is a numeric input component that allows users to adjust a number by incrementing or decrementing with dedicated buttons, or by directly entering a value. It enforces minimum and maximum bounds and prevents operations that would violate those bounds.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **accept-numeric-value**: Component MUST accept an initial numeric value via the `value` prop.
- **call-onchange-handler**: Component MUST invoke the provided `onChange` handler with the new numeric value when the user increments, decrements, or directly edits the input.
- **clamp-to-bounds**: Component MUST clamp all values to the specified `min` and `max` bounds; values outside the range MUST be automatically adjusted to the nearest boundary.
- **respect-step-size**: Component MUST increment and decrement by the specified `step` amount (default 1).
- **keyboard-arrow-step**: While the input has focus, ArrowUp and ArrowDown MUST adjust the value by `step`, via the native `<input type="number">` spin behavior; the component adds no custom key handling beyond what the browser provides for numeric inputs.
- **disable-decrement-at-min**: Decrement button MUST be disabled when the current value is less than or equal to `min`.
- **disable-increment-at-max**: Increment button MUST be disabled when the current value is greater than or equal to `max`.
- **disable-all-controls-when-disabled**: When the `disabled` prop is `true`, all interactive elements (buttons and input) MUST be disabled and MUST NOT respond to user interaction.
- **support-direct-input**: Component MUST accept direct numeric input via an input field; non-numeric entries MUST be rejected or ignored.
- **support-optional-label**: Component MUST render an optional label element associated with the input field via `htmlFor` attribute when `label` prop is provided.
- **support-optional-hint**: Component MUST render an optional hint or help text below the control when `hint` prop is provided.
- **custom-classname**: Component MAY accept a custom CSS class name via the `className` prop for styling overrides.
- **custom-id**: Component MAY accept a custom element ID via the `id` prop; if not provided, a unique ID MUST be generated automatically.

## Appearance

- **Corner radius**: 4px (control-specific border radius; varies by platform design system)
- **Padding**: Buttons and input inherit field padding from the `{{app_prefix}}` field styling (reference implementation: 8px vertical × 12px horizontal)
- **Font**: 14px regular weight for input value (reference implementation; scale with the app's type tokens)
- **Background**: Input background uses the theme's surface/background color token; button backgrounds inherit from `{{app_prefix}}` field styling
- **Foreground/Text**: Theme text color token (reference implementation: dark text on light backgrounds)
- **Border**: 1px solid, theme border color token; focus state applies the theme's focus outline
- **Shadow**: None (flat design)
- **Min/Max size**: Minimum width determined by button size and input width; no maximum enforced

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|-------|------------------|
| Default | Input visible with both buttons enabled; neutral colors |
| Value at min | Decrement button appears disabled (opacity/color change); increment button enabled |
| Value at max | Increment button appears disabled (opacity/color change); decrement button enabled |
| Disabled | All controls (input, both buttons) appear disabled; text color dimmed; interaction disabled |
| Focused (input) | Blue outline or focus ring applied to input field per platform standards |
| Focused (button) | Blue outline or focus ring applied to focused button |

## Accessibility

- **Role**: The input MUST have `role="spinbutton"` or be a native `<input type="number">` element (preferred). Buttons MUST be implemented as native `<button type="button">` elements; `role="button"` MUST NOT be reasserted via ARIA since it is already implicit on `<button>`.
- **Label**: When a label is provided, the input MUST be associated via `<label htmlFor>` attribute. If no label is provided but hint or context exists, the input SHOULD have an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- **Button labels**: Decrement and increment buttons MUST have clear, descriptive `aria-label` attributes, sourced from the localized strings ("Decrement", "Increment"; see Localization). These labels are generic and do not incorporate the field's `label` (see Edge Cases).
- **Announce disabled state**: When a button is disabled, its `disabled` attribute MUST be set; screen readers announce this state automatically.
- **Minimum tap target**: Buttons MUST be at least 44×44pt on iOS and 48×48dp on Android; web buttons SHOULD be at least 44×44px.
- **Keyboard navigation**: Input MUST accept focus and allow direct number entry via keyboard. While focused, ArrowUp/ArrowDown MUST adjust the value by `step` (see **keyboard-arrow-step**); PageUp/PageDown and Home/End are not handled, since native `<input type="number">` elements do not provide that behavior and the component adds no custom key handling. Buttons MUST accept focus and respond to Enter or Space key presses (native `<button>` behavior).

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| stepper-001 | accept-numeric-value | value=5 | Input displays "5" |
| stepper-002 | call-onchange-handler | User clicks increment button, value=5, step=1 | onChange called with 6 |

| stepper-017 | clamp-to-bounds | User types "25" in input, max=20 | Value clamped to 20; onChange called with 20 |
| stepper-018 | keyboard-arrow-step | User presses ArrowUp with input focused, value=5, step=1 | onChange called with 6 (native `<input type="number">` spin behavior) |
| stepper-019 | respect-step-size | User clicks increment, value=0.2, step=0.1 | onChange called with 0.30000000000000004 (no rounding is performed; result reflects raw floating-point addition) |
| stepper-020 | support-direct-input | User clears the input (types ""), value=7, min=5 | onChange called with 5 (empty string parses to 0, then clamped to min) |
| stepper-021 | clamp-to-bounds | User types "5" (first keystroke while entering "50"), min=10 | onChange called with 10 immediately after the first keystroke, before the second digit is typed |

## Edge Cases

- **Null or undefined min/max**: When `min` or `max` is not provided, the component treats them as -Infinity and +Infinity respectively. Clamping with infinite bounds works correctly.
- **Step smaller than 1**: The component supports fractional steps (e.g., step=0.5). Values MUST be clamped correctly; direct input MUST accept decimals matching the step size. The component performs no rounding to the step's precision, so repeated fractional increments can accumulate ordinary IEEE-754 floating-point drift (for example, incrementing from `0.2` by `step=0.1` yields `0.30000000000000004`, not `0.3`; see stepper-019).
- **Step larger than range**: If step size is larger than (max - min), incrementing from min jumps to or beyond max, triggering the max-bounds behavior. This is correct per clamping logic.
- **Direct input of boundary values**: User enters exactly min or max value. Component MUST accept it and MUST NOT reject valid boundary entries.
- **Direct input while at boundary**: User is at max value, types a new number below max, and increments. The new value MUST respect the typed entry and the subsequent increment — each call to the increment/decrement/direct-input handler clamps independently, so the most recently applied value takes precedence over any prior one (see **clamp-to-bounds**).
- **Disabled state with valid/invalid values**: When disabled=true, the component MUST NOT respond to button clicks or input changes regardless of the current value or bounds.
- **Empty or whitespace input**: `Number('')` evaluates to `0` (not `NaN`), so clearing the field is treated as entering `0` and is clamped like any other value (to `min` when `min > 0`); it is not preserved as blank or left unchanged (see stepper-020).
- **Clamping happens per keystroke, not on commit**: Clamping is applied immediately after every change, including each keystroke during direct text entry — not only on blur or Enter. Typing toward a multi-digit value that starts outside the current range (for example typing "5" then "0" to reach "50" when `min=10`) clamps the intermediate "5" up to `10` before the second digit is entered (see stepper-021).
- **Invalid configuration (`min > max`, `step <= 0`, non-finite `value`)**: The component performs no validation on these inputs. When `min > max`, clamping always resolves to `min` regardless of the requested value (`Math.max(min, Math.min(max, n))` collapses to `min` whenever `max < min`). When `step <= 0`, incrementing/decrementing with `step=0` calls `onChange` with the value unchanged, and a negative `step` inverts the buttons' effect (increment decreases the value, decrement increases it). When `value` is `NaN`, the `<= min` / `>= max` comparisons are always false, so neither button is disabled regardless of bounds. No warning is raised in any of these cases.
- **Multiple steppers per page**: Button accessible names are the generic localized strings ("Decrement" / "Increment") and do not include the field's `label`; a screen with more than one stepper has no built-in way to distinguish them by button label alone.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `value` | number | required | Current numeric value |
| `onChange` | (value: number) => void | required | Callback invoked when value changes |
| `min` | number | -Infinity | Minimum allowed value |
| `max` | number | +Infinity | Maximum allowed value |
| `step` | number | 1 | Increment/decrement step size |
| `disabled` | boolean | false | Disables all controls |
| `label` | ReactNode | undefined | Optional label text or element |
| `hint` | ReactNode | undefined | Optional hint or help text |
| `className` | string | undefined | Optional custom CSS class |
| `id` | string | auto-generated | Optional custom element ID |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: Stepper is a form control component with no standalone URL routing behavior.

## Localization

| String Key | Default (en) | Context |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `stepper.decrement` | "Decrement" | aria-label for decrement button |
| `stepper.increment` | "Increment" | aria-label for increment button |

## Accessibility Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Reduce Motion | No motion or transitions applied in the component; button and input state changes occur instantly |
| Increase Contrast | Border color and text color SHOULD increase to meet AAA contrast requirements (7:1 minimum); disabled state text SHOULD remain distinguishable |
| Differentiate Without Color | Disabled buttons MUST indicate disabled state via the native `disabled` attribute (browsers render it with reduced opacity and a non-interactive cursor) rather than color alone; the −/+ glyph itself remains visible in both states. Screen readers announce the disabled state independently through the `disabled` attribute (see **screen-reader-support**) — `aria-label` is not a visible cue and MUST NOT be relied on to satisfy this option. |

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: Stepper is a core form component with no feature flag requirements.

## Analytics

Not applicable: The source emits no analytics events. Instrumentation is the consumer's responsibility, layered on top of **call-onchange-handler** (see Design Decisions).

## Privacy

- **Data collected**: The current numeric value only (no sensitive metadata).
- **Storage**: Value is maintained in component state during the session; not persisted by the component itself.
- **Transmission**: No data is transmitted by the component; the consumer (`onChange` handler) determines what is done with the value.
- **Retention**: Value is ephemeral within the component lifecycle; retention depends on the consuming application.

## Logging

Not applicable: The source contains no logging calls. Any logging of value changes is the consumer's responsibility, layered on top of **call-onchange-handler**.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: Use `Stepper(value:in:step:)` or a custom composition with `Button` + `TextField` + `HStack` layout. Bind `value` to a `@State` property; the framework handles clamping. Stepper in SwiftUI does not display the numeric value directly—pair it with a Text view or TextField if the value must be visible. For a visible value and manual increment/decrement, compose with `VStack` containing a TextField for direct input and HStack buttons for increment/decrement.

- **Compose**: Implement using `Row` with `IconButton` (decrement/increment) flanking a `TextField`. Use `value` state and `onValueChange` callback. Apply bounds checking with `coerceIn(min, max)`. Set button enabled state conditionally based on current value vs. min/max. Use `BasicTextField` or `OutlinedTextField` for the value display.

- **React/Web**: The reference implementation (`packages/web/packages/controls/src/user-settings/components/Stepper.tsx`) uses a native `<input type="number">` with `<button type="button">` elements flanking it in a flex container. Its own CSS classes are named `aws-field` / `aws-stepper`; a consuming app SHOULD follow the `{{app_prefix}}-field` / `{{app_prefix}}-stepper` naming pattern instead. A `noAutofillProps` helper prevents browser autofill on the input field. Treat the reference implementation as the behavioral contract for this recipe.

- **AppKit / UIKit**: Use `NSStepper` on macOS or `UIStepper` on iOS. Both provide increment/decrement buttons and value management. `UIStepper` does not display the numeric value by default—pair it with a UITextField or UILabel to show the current value. Configure `minimumValue`, `maximumValue`, and `stepValue` properties. Bind target-action or delegation to capture value changes.

- **WinUI 3**: Implement using `NumberBox` control with `Value`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, and `SmallChange` (step) properties. NumberBox renders spin buttons (increment/decrement) inline with a text input by default. Set `IsEnabled` to manage the disabled state. Handle `ValueChanged` event to invoke the onChange callback. SpinButtonPlacementMode can be set to `Compact` or `Inline` to control button placement.

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: All numeric values are clamped to `[min, max]` bounds immediately after any change (button click or each keystroke of direct input).
  **Rationale**: This prevents out-of-range values from being passed to the consumer and avoids state inconsistency.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: When `min` or `max` is not provided, they default to `-Infinity` and `+Infinity` respectively.
  **Rationale**: This allows unconstrained ranges while simplifying the API (no separate "unbounded" mode).
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: Buttons are disabled when an operation would exceed bounds (`value <= min` disables decrement; `value >= max` disables increment).
  **Rationale**: This prevents repeated clicks from attempting invalid operations and provides clear affordance to users.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: Non-numeric input is silently ignored via a `Number.isNaN()` check; an empty or whitespace input parses to `0` and is committed like any other value (see Edge Cases).
  **Rationale**: This provides lenient error handling without introducing error states, though it means blank input is treated as zero rather than as "no value."
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: Buttons use `aria-label` for concise, standalone labels ("Decrement", "Increment") rather than `aria-describedby`.
  **Rationale**: The action is self-contained and descriptive, so a short accessible name is sufficient.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: The stepper emits only `onChange`; it performs no analytics tracking and no logging.
  **Rationale**: A leaf form primitive should not own telemetry — mixing instrumentation into input handling couples unrelated concerns. Consumers that need analytics or logging compose it around **call-onchange-handler**.
  **Approved**: pending

The source uses a native `<button type="button">` and `<input type="number">` with correct `aria-label`/`disabled` attributes, so screen-reader-support, keyboard-navigable, and semantic-markup pass; it hardcodes the "Decrement"/"Increment" strings directly in JSX rather than resolving them through the localization keys in this recipe's Localization section, so string-externalization and no-hardcoded-strings fail; and it defines colors, font size, and control dimensions only through CSS classes not shown in the source file, so contrast, type scaling, and tap-target size cannot be confirmed and are marked partial.
