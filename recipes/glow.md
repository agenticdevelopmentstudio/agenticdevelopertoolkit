# Glow

## Overview

The Glow component is a purely decorative visual element that renders a styled `<div>` with a glow effect. It is excluded from accessibility trees (`aria-hidden="true"`) and serves only as visual enhancement. Visual appearance is entirely managed through CSS classes (base class `lp-glow` plus optional additional classes). When nested inside a centered screen (the hero), the glow's vertical offset is derived from the hero's own `--lp-hero-pad-top` and `--lp-hero-pad-bottom` custom properties (see the hero ingredient) rather than a hardcoded constant.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-as-div**: Component MUST render a `<div>` element.
- **aria-hidden**: Component MUST set `aria-hidden="true"` on the rendered element.
- **classname-prop**: Component MUST accept an optional `className` prop (`string | undefined`).
- **base-class**: Component MUST always apply the `lp-glow` class to the rendered element.
- **combine-classnames**: The rendered element's class list MUST equal `lp-glow` plus the tokens of `className`, with no empty tokens.

## Appearance

- **Corner radius**: `border-radius: 50%` — combined with equal width and height, this renders a full circle.
- **Padding**: None — the `lp-glow` CSS class declares no padding.
- **Font**: Not applicable (element contains no text)
- **Background**: `background: var(--lp-glow, radial-gradient(circle, rgba(216, 216, 216, 0.1), transparent 65%))` — a soft light-gray radial gradient at 10% opacity, fading to transparent by 65% of the circle's radius.
- **Foreground/Text**: Not applicable (element contains no text)
- **Border**: None — the `lp-glow` CSS class declares no border.
- **Shadow**: None — the `lp-glow` CSS class declares no `box-shadow`.
- **Min/Max size**: Fixed `width: 62rem` and `height: 62rem`. Positioned `absolute`, `left: 50%`, `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`, `z-index: -1`, `pointer-events: none`. Default vertical offset is `top: calc(var(--lp-screen-pad-top, clamp(5.5rem, 14svh, 9rem)) + 9rem)`; inside a hero (`.lp-screen--center`) it is instead `top: calc(50% + (var(--lp-hero-pad-top, 6.5rem) - var(--lp-hero-pad-bottom, var(--lp-dock-clear, 0px))) / 2)`.

## States

Not applicable: This component is purely decorative and stateless; it does not enter any interactive states.

## Accessibility

Not applicable: The component is explicitly hidden from accessibility trees via `aria-hidden="true"` and carries no semantic role or purpose for assistive technologies.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| glow-001 | render-as-div | None | Component renders as HTML `<div>` element |
| glow-002 | aria-hidden | None | Rendered element includes `aria-hidden="true"` |
| glow-003 | base-class | None | Rendered element has class 'lp-glow' |
| glow-004 | combine-classnames | `className="custom-glow"` | Rendered element has classes 'lp-glow' and 'custom-glow' |
| glow-005 | combine-classnames | `className=""` | Rendered element has class 'lp-glow' only (empty string filtered) |
| glow-006 | combine-classnames | `className={undefined}` | Rendered element has class 'lp-glow' only (undefined filtered) |
| glow-007 | classname-prop, combine-classnames | No className prop | Rendered element has class 'lp-glow' only |
| glow-008 | combine-classnames | `className="a b"` | Rendered element's class attribute is `lp-glow a b`; class list contains the tokens `lp-glow`, `a`, and `b` |
| glow-009 | combine-classnames | `className="   "` (whitespace only) | Rendered element's class attribute is `lp-glow` followed by the whitespace-only string; the browser's class-attribute tokenizer resolves this to the single class-list token `lp-glow` |

## Edge Cases

- **Undefined className**: Falsy; filtered from the combined class list. Element renders with 'lp-glow' only.
- **Empty string className**: Empty string is falsy and filtered. Element renders with 'lp-glow' only.
- **Whitespace-only className**: The string is truthy, so it is not filtered. The rendered `class` attribute becomes `class="lp-glow   "`; a browser's class-attribute tokenizer splits on ASCII whitespace and discards empty tokens, so this resolves to the single token `lp-glow`.
- **Multi-token className**: Each whitespace-separated token supplied in `className` (e.g. `"a b"`) is preserved as its own token in the rendered class list, alongside `lp-glow`.

## Configuration

Not applicable: The component accepts only an optional `className` prop; it has no configurable options or variants.

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: The component is a decorative visual element with no navigational or deep-linking capability.

## Localization

Not applicable: The component contains no text or user-facing strings.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: The component is explicitly hidden from accessibility trees and does not respond to accessibility display options.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: No feature flags control the rendering or visibility of this component.

## Analytics

Not applicable: The component does not emit or track analytics events.

## Privacy

Not applicable: The component does not collect, store, or transmit data.

## Logging

Not applicable: The component does not emit diagnostic logs.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web**: Implemented in `packages/web/packages/landing/src/deck/Glow.tsx` as a functional component. Exports a `Glow` function accepting `{ className?: string }`. Combines 'lp-glow' base class with the optional className prop using `[...].filter(Boolean).join(' ')`. The rendered `<div>` is always `aria-hidden`. Visual styling is delegated entirely to CSS classes in the application's stylesheet (`css/base.css`'s `.lp-glow` rule), with the hero variant's positioning offset derived from the hero's padding custom properties.

- **SwiftUI**: Implement using a transparent `View` with a `RadialGradient` or layered `Canvas` to create the glow effect. Apply `.accessibilityHidden(true)` to exclude from VoiceOver and `.allowsHitTesting(false)` to keep it non-interactive. Use environment or view properties to apply styling derived from design tokens that match the web CSS definitions.

- **Compose**: Use a `Box` or `Canvas` composable with `Brush.radialGradient` or a `blur` modifier to produce the glow. Apply `Modifier.clearAndSetSemantics {}` to hide the purely decorative node from accessibility services. Layer multiple elements with alpha blending if needed to achieve the visual effect.

- **AppKit / UIKit**: On macOS, create an `NSView` subclass with `CAGradientLayer` (radial) or custom drawing for the glow, call `setAccessibilityElement(false)`, and override `hitTest(_:)` to return `nil` so the view never intercepts clicks. On iOS, use a `UIView` with `CAGradientLayer` or similar, set `isAccessibilityElement = false`, `accessibilityElementsHidden = true`, and `isUserInteractionEnabled = false`.

- **WinUI 3**: Render a `Border` or `Grid` with a `RadialGradientBrush` to create the glow effect. Set `IsHitTestVisible="False"` to prevent interaction. Apply `AutomationProperties.AccessibilityView="Raw"` to remove it from the automation tree (`IsOffscreenBehavior` does not remove an element from the tree, and `UIElement` has no `Effect`/`BlurEffect` property — those are WPF-only). Achieve the blur, if wanted, with a Composition `GaussianBlurEffect` via Win2D, or approximate it with a feathered `RadialGradientBrush`.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: The `aria-hidden="true"` attribute is fixed and non-configurable.
**Rationale**: The component has no semantic purpose for assistive technology; there is no case where it should be exposed to the accessibility tree.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Visual appearance is delegated entirely to CSS (base class `lp-glow` plus an optional caller-supplied `className`) rather than exposed through component props.
**Rationale**: Decouples visual design from component logic, allowing design changes without code modification.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Inside a hero, the glow's vertical offset is computed from the hero's own `--lp-hero-pad-top` / `--lp-hero-pad-bottom` custom properties rather than a hardcoded constant.
**Rationale**: Keeps the glow visually aligned with the hero's content as hero padding changes, so the two measurements cannot drift apart.
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [semantic-markup](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#semantic-markup) | passed | Accessibility |
| [separation-of-concerns](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/best-practices#separation-of-concerns) | passed | Best Practices |
| [unit-test-coverage](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/best-practices#unit-test-coverage) | partial | Best Practices |

Passed because the source (`Glow.tsx`) sets `aria-hidden` directly on the rendered `<div>`, correctly using ARIA to hide this purely decorative element from the accessibility tree. `separation-of-concerns` is `passed` because the component is pure presentation with no children and no logic beyond a class-name join; `unit-test-coverage` is `partial` because no test renders `Glow` directly — `deck.test.tsx` and `blocks-close.test.tsx` only assert its `.lp-glow`/`aria-hidden` output through the `Screen` and `Hero` parents that compose it.
