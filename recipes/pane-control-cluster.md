# Pane Control Cluster

## Overview

A horizontal cluster of three buttons at the leading edge of a pane's title bar: close, minimize, and zoom. The component mirrors the arrangement and meanings of the window title bar controls, ensuring visual and behavioral consistency. The cluster reports state (zoomed, minimized, enabled/disabled) and does not make decisions about pane lifecycle — the hosting container retains full responsibility for closing, resizing, and state management.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-three-buttons**: The component MUST render exactly three buttons in left-to-right order: close, minimize, zoom.
- **standard-glyphs**: The component MUST display SF Symbol glyphs in the default state: "xmark" for close, "minus" for minimize, "arrow.up.left.and.arrow.down.right" for zoom. State-dependent glyph changes are covered by **render-minimized-state** and **render-zoomed-state**.
- **report-close-action**: The component MUST invoke the `onClose` closure when the close button is activated.
- **report-minimize-action**: The component MUST invoke the `onMinimize` closure when the minimize button is activated in the non-minimized state, passing a reference to the button itself as an anchor point (for example, so the host can present a picker popover from it without looking the button up again). On platforms without a native view-reference type, the host receives an equivalent positional anchor (e.g., a frame/rect in the cluster's coordinate space).
- **report-restore-action**: The component MUST invoke the `onRestore` closure when the minimize button is activated in the minimized state.
- **report-zoom-action**: The component MUST invoke the `onZoom` closure when the zoom button is activated.
- **render-minimized-state**: When `isMinimized` is true, the component MUST render the minimize button with a "plus" glyph, "Restore Pane" label, "pane.restore" accessibility ID, and enable it regardless of `canMinimize`.
- **render-zoomed-state**: When `isZoomed` is true, the component MUST render the zoom button with the "arrow.down.right.and.arrow.up.left" glyph and "Unzoom Pane" label; when false, MUST render "arrow.up.left.and.arrow.down.right" and "Zoom Pane" label.
- **disable-close-button**: When `canClose` is false, the component MUST disable the close button and tint it with the tertiary text color (in place of the secondary text color used when enabled).
- **disable-minimize-button**: When `canMinimize` is false and `isMinimized` is false, the component MUST disable the minimize button and tint it with the tertiary text color (in place of the secondary text color used when enabled).
- **respond-to-state-changes**: The component MUST respond to changes in `isZoomed`, `isMinimized`, `canMinimize`, and `canClose` properties and update the button appearances and enabled states accordingly.
- **borderless-icon-buttons**: The component MUST render each button borderless, with only its glyph visible (no title text, no bezel/border).
- **tinted-glyph-color**: The component MUST tint each glyph using a single content color, so the color can be swapped centrally for enabled/disabled state and for theme changes (see **theme-aware-tinting**).
- **theme-aware-tinting**: The component MUST observe theme changes and re-apply tinting to all buttons: secondary text color for enabled buttons, tertiary text color for disabled buttons.

## Appearance

- **Layout**: Horizontal stack, 2pt spacing between buttons, centered vertically
- **Buttons**: Three equal-sized button controls with no border
- **Glyphs**: SF Symbols rendered at system size, tinted (not filled)
- **Spacing**: 2pt between each button
- **Padding**: None specified; buttons manage their own bounds
- **Background**: Transparent; inherits from container
- **Tint**: Secondary text color (enabled), tertiary text color (disabled), theme-responsive

## States

| State | Appearance Change |
|-------|------------------|
| Default (not zoomed, not minimized, all enabled) | Close: "xmark" enabled; Minimize: "minus" enabled; Zoom: "arrow.up.left.and.arrow.down.right" enabled |
| Zoomed | Zoom button: "arrow.down.right.and.arrow.up.left" glyph; label changes to "Unzoom Pane" |
| Minimized | Minimize button: "plus" glyph, label "Restore Pane", enabled regardless of `canMinimize`; minimize button appears in restore role |
| Close disabled | Close button: tertiary text color tint, no interaction |
| Minimize disabled | Minimize button: tertiary text color tint (only when not minimized) |
| Dark mode | Tinting automatically adjusts to match dark theme; secondary/tertiary text colors recalculated |
| Light mode | Tinting automatically adjusts to match light theme; secondary/tertiary text colors recalculated |

## Accessibility

- **Role/trait**: Container with three buttons, each with button role
- **Accessibility IDs**: Close: "pane.close"; Minimize: "pane.minimize" (or "pane.restore" when minimized); Zoom: "pane.zoom"
- **Accessibility labels**: Close: "Close Pane"; Minimize: "Minimize Pane" or "Restore Pane"; Zoom: "Zoom Pane" or "Unzoom Pane"
- **Tooltips**: Identical to accessibility labels; displayed on hover
- **Glyph accessibility**: Each button's SF Symbol includes an accessibility description matching its label (e.g., "Close Pane" for the xmark)
- **State announcements**: Minimize button's label and glyph change reflect the state; screen readers announce the change on next access
- **Minimum target size**: macOS (pointer-based, `.accessoryBarAction` bezel): no fixed minimum is enforced; the button matches the compact sizing convention of system window controls. iOS (touch, per the UIKit port in Platform Notes): 44×44pt per Apple HIG.

| cluster-009 | render-zoomed-state | `isZoomed = false` | Zoom button renders "arrow.up.left.and.arrow.down.right" glyph, "Zoom Pane" label |
| cluster-010 | disable-close-button | `canClose = false` | Close button disabled, tinted with the tertiary text color |
| cluster-011 | disable-minimize-button | `isMinimized = false`, `canMinimize = false` | Minimize button disabled, tinted with the tertiary text color |
| cluster-012 | disable-minimize-button | `isMinimized = true`, `canMinimize = false` | Minimize button enabled (restore state overrides `canMinimize` disable) |
| cluster-013 | respond-to-state-changes | `isZoomed` changes from false to true | Zoom button glyph and label update immediately |
| cluster-014 | respond-to-state-changes | `canClose` changes from true to false | Close button immediately disables and re-tints to the tertiary text color |
| cluster-015 | theme-aware-tinting | System theme changes to dark mode | All button tints re-resolve to dark theme secondary/tertiary text colors |
| cluster-016 | borderless-icon-buttons, tinted-glyph-color | Component rendered | No border visible; buttons appear borderless; glyphs tinted, not filled |
| cluster-017 | render-three-buttons | Component initialized | Close/minimize/zoom buttons expose accessibility IDs "pane.close"/"pane.minimize"/"pane.zoom" and labels "Close Pane"/"Minimize Pane"/"Zoom Pane" |
| cluster-018 | render-three-buttons | Component initialized | Each button's tooltip equals its accessibility label |
| cluster-019 | render-minimized-state | `isMinimized = true` | Minimize button's tooltip equals "Restore Pane" |
| cluster-020 | render-zoomed-state | `isZoomed = true` | Zoom button's tooltip equals "Unzoom Pane" |
| cluster-021 | disable-close-button | `canClose = false` | Close button's content tint resolves to the palette's tertiary-text color (a color swap, not an alpha/opacity change) |
| cluster-022 | disable-minimize-button | `isMinimized = false`, `canMinimize = false` | Minimize button's content tint resolves to the palette's tertiary-text color (a color swap, not an alpha/opacity change) |
| cluster-023 | report-close-action, report-minimize-action, report-restore-action, report-zoom-action | `onClose`, `onMinimize`, `onRestore`, `onZoom` all nil | Activating any button has no effect and does not crash |
| cluster-024 | respond-to-state-changes | `isMinimized` changes from false to true | Minimize button transitions from "minus" / "Minimize Pane" / "pane.minimize" / `canMinimize`-gated enabled state to "plus" / "Restore Pane" / "pane.restore" / always-enabled state |
| cluster-025 | render-three-buttons | macOS button rendered with the `.accessoryBarAction` bezel | Hit area matches the compact accessory-bar sizing convention; no 44×44pt minimum is enforced, consistent with system window-control sizing |
| cluster-026 | render-three-buttons | iOS UIKit port renders the equivalent buttons (see Platform Notes) | Each button's hit area is at least 44×44pt per Apple HIG |
| cluster-027 | theme-aware-tinting | System Increase Contrast enabled | Button tint resolves through the semantic palette's secondary/tertiary tokens, which supply higher-contrast values automatically |
| cluster-028 | render-minimized-state | Differentiate Without Color enabled | Minimize button's state is distinguished by glyph shape (minus vs. plus) and accessibility label, not by color alone |

## Edge Cases

- **Minimize when canMinimize is false**: Component ignores clicks on the minimize button; the button appears disabled. When `isMinimized` becomes true programmatically (set by the host), the button becomes enabled and shows restore state.
- **Restore when isMinimized is true**: The minimize button is always enabled while `isMinimized = true`, even if `canMinimize = false`. This ensures the user can always restore a minimized pane.
- **Close when canClose is false**: Component ignores clicks on the close button; the button appears disabled. The button remains visually reachable (disabled, not hidden) to communicate state, not capability, per principle-of-least-astonishment.
- **Multiple state changes in sequence**: If `isZoomed`, `isMinimized`, `canClose`, and `canMinimize` are all modified before layout occurs, the component updates all three buttons in a single internal pass, rather than updating each one independently as its own property changes — see **respond-to-state-changes**.
- **Theme changes during interaction**: If the system theme changes while a button is highlighted or being interacted with, the component re-applies tinting immediately — see **theme-aware-tinting**.
- **No actions configured**: All four closures (`onClose`, `onMinimize`, `onRestore`, `onZoom`) are optional. If a closure is nil, activating the corresponding button has no effect.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `isZoomed` | `Bool` | `false` | Flips the zoom glyph and tooltip. Set by the host; the component never infers it from a click. |
| `isMinimized` | `Bool` | `false` | Turns the minimize button into restore — glyph, tooltip, action, and accessibility identifier. |
| `canMinimize` | `Bool` | `true` | False for a pane with no sibling to hand its space to. Ignored while minimized, so restoring stays reachable. |
| `canClose` | `Bool` | `true` | False for a pane its container will not give up. |
| `onClose` | `(() -> Void)?` | `nil` | Invoked when the close button is activated. |
| `onMinimize` | `((NSButton) -> Void)?` | `nil` | Invoked, with the minimize button as an anchor, when it is activated in the non-minimized state. |
| `onRestore` | `(() -> Void)?` | `nil` | Invoked when the minimize button is activated in the minimized state. |
| `onZoom` | `(() -> Void)?` | `nil` | Invoked when the zoom button is activated. |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: This component is a UI control cluster with no deep linking semantics; navigation and routing belong to the hosting pane or window container.

## Localization

All user-visible text is produced by the accessibility labels and tooltips below (identical per state). The source hard-codes them as English string literals — there is no `NSLocalizedString` call, string catalog, or localization provider in `PaneControlCluster.swift`.

| String Key | Default (en) | Context |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| pane.close.label | Close Pane | Accessibility label and tooltip for the close button |
| pane.minimize.label | Minimize Pane | Accessibility label and tooltip for the minimize button, non-minimized state |
| pane.restore.label | Restore Pane | Accessibility label and tooltip for the minimize button, minimized state |
| pane.zoom.label | Zoom Pane | Accessibility label and tooltip for the zoom button, non-zoomed state |
| pane.unzoom.label | Unzoom Pane | Accessibility label and tooltip for the zoom button, zoomed state |

## Accessibility Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Reduce Motion | Not applicable: The component has no animations; it renders states instantly. Reduce Motion does not affect visual appearance. |
| Increase Contrast | Supported: the component's tint is sourced from the semantic palette's secondary and tertiary text tokens, and the palette resolves those tokens to higher-contrast values when Increase Contrast is on; the component picks this up automatically — see **theme-aware-tinting**. |
| Differentiate Without Color | Supported: state is conveyed by glyph shape (xmark, minus/plus, the two diagonal-arrow variants) and by accessibility labels, never by color alone. |

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: This component has no feature flag gates; it is always enabled when instantiated.

## Analytics

Not applicable: The component does not emit analytics events; event tracking belongs to the hosting container.

## Privacy

Not applicable: The component does not collect, store, or transmit any user data or personal information.

## Logging

Not applicable: The component does not emit diagnostic logs. Hosting containers may log user interactions with pane controls.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: Wrap `PaneControlCluster` (an `NSViewRepresentable`, macOS 14.0+) in a state-binding adapter: pass `@State` values for `isZoomed`, `isMinimized`, `canMinimize`, `canClose` in, and forward the four closures out. SwiftUI has no built-in `ButtonStyle` equivalent to AppKit's `.accessoryBarAction` bezel, so a pure-SwiftUI port needs a custom `ButtonStyle` that renders icon-only content (no title, no background, no border) and drives the glyph's foreground color from `isEnabled` the same way the AppKit source drives `contentTintColor`.
- **Compose**: Build an equivalent using three composable buttons in a `Row` with a small fixed spacing (2dp). Use Material Design 3 icon buttons (`IconButton`) with appropriate icons (close, minimize, unfold less/more). Apply theme-aware tinting via the `contentColor` parameter. Keep the composable stateless: accept `isZoomed`, `isMinimized`, `canMinimize`, and `canClose` as parameters from the caller — never hold them in local `remember { mutableStateOf(...) }` state — and emit `onClose`/`onMinimize`/`onRestore`/`onZoom` callbacks. The host, not the composable, owns and mutates the state, matching the AppKit source.
- **React/Web**: Render three buttons in a horizontal flex container with a 2px gap. Use specific SVG icon sets rather than ambiguous glyphs — for example Lucide's `x` (close), `minus`/`plus` (minimize/restore), and `maximize-2`/`minimize-2` (zoom/unzoom). Apply `aria-label` matching each state's accessibility label ("Close Pane", "Minimize Pane"/"Restore Pane", "Zoom Pane"/"Unzoom Pane"), and set `aria-pressed` (or swap the label, matching the platform pattern above) on the zoom button so its toggled state is exposed to assistive tech. Toggle `disabled` and `aria-disabled` based on the four state properties. Use CSS custom properties for theme-aware text-color tinting (secondary/tertiary).
- **AppKit / UIKit**: The source `PaneControlCluster.swift` is the canonical AppKit implementation: `NSButton` with `bezelStyle = .accessoryBarAction`, `isBordered = false`, `imagePosition = .imageOnly`, and `contentTintColor` driving glyph color (see **borderless-icon-buttons**, **tinted-glyph-color**). State changes funnel through a single internal update pass so the three buttons never see the four flags in an inconsistent order, and a theme observer re-resolves tint on system appearance changes (see **theme-aware-tinting**). On UIKit (iOS 17.0+), adapt using three `UIButton` instances configured with system images and equivalent styling (`.plain()` configuration, no background, template image with `tintColor`). Manage state via observed properties, KVO, or Combine publishers if the hosting container uses reactive patterns. On macOS with AppKit, use `PaneControlCluster` directly from AgenticDeveloperToolkit.
- **WinUI 3**: Use three `Button` controls in a `StackPanel` with `Orientation="Horizontal"` and `Spacing="2"`. Apply `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.FontIcon` with the Segoe Fluent Icons glyphs: `` (ChromeClose) for close, `` (ChromeMinimize) for minimize, `` (ChromeMaximize) for zoom, and `` (ChromeRestore) for unzoom. Set the `IsEnabled` binding for each button based on the four state flags. Use `Foreground` to apply theme-aware tinting (secondary/tertiary text from app theme resources). Bind `Click` (or `Command`) to a handler that dispatches to the four callbacks, giving the minimize button its dual minimize/restore role based on current state.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: The cluster mirrors the order and meanings of the window title bar's close/minimize/zoom controls, not their exact glyphs — macOS window controls are colored circles, while this cluster uses SF Symbol glyphs.
**Rationale**: Principle of least astonishment: a pane is a window-shaped thing inside a window, and a reader who has to learn a second control arrangement pays for nothing.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: A disabled button (`canClose = false`, or `canMinimize = false` while not minimized) is rendered dim (tertiary text color tint) rather than hidden.
**Rationale**: A live-looking, unresponsive button reads as a broken pane; a dim button reads as a protected one, which matches the host's responsibility model — the host decides whether a pane may be closed or minimized.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The minimize button serves a dual role (minimize / restore), swapping its glyph, label, tooltip, and accessibility identifier based on `isMinimized`, rather than showing a second button.
**Rationale**: Keeps the control cluster compact while accessibility stays correct, since the identifier and label always match the button's current role.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The component observes system theme changes and re-applies each button's tint automatically, rather than requiring the host to push an explicit update when the system appearance changes.
**Rationale**: Keeps theme-responsiveness self-contained; the host only has to manage `isZoomed`, `isMinimized`, `canMinimize`, and `canClose` — appearance follow-through is the component's job.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The component never infers `isZoomed` from a click; only the host sets it, after deciding whether to grant the zoom request.
**Rationale**: The pane's zoom state must always reflect the host's actual internal state — a click is a request, not an outcome, and the host may refuse it.
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [screen-reader-support](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#screen-reader-support) | passed | Accessibility |
| [keyboard-navigable](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#keyboard-navigable) | partial | Accessibility |
| [contrast-ratio](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#contrast-ratio) | partial | Accessibility |
| [touch-target-size](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#touch-target-size) | partial | Accessibility |
| [string-externalization](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/internationalization#string-externalization) | failed | Internationalization |
| [no-hardcoded-strings](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/internationalization#no-hardcoded-strings) | failed | Internationalization |
| [text-expansion-tolerance](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/internationalization#text-expansion-tolerance) | passed | Internationalization |
| [rtl-layout-support](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/internationalization#rtl-layout-support) | partial | Internationalization |

Screen-reader-support and the hard-coded-string findings come directly from the source (`setAccessibilityLabel`/`accessibilityID` calls on every button, versus inline English literals with no localization call); text-expansion-tolerance passes because the buttons are icon-only and carry no visible title text to overflow. Keyboard, contrast, touch-target, and RTL statuses are partial because they rely on default AppKit and palette behavior that `PaneControlCluster.swift` does not itself exercise or measure.
