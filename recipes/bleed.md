# Bleed

## Overview

Bleed extends a child element past the content column boundary toward one page edge, creating the visual effect of the element being cropped by the viewport rather than sitting politely inside the measure. This produces a "window onto something larger" visual metaphor: a frame with air on both sides reads as a picture of an app, while a frame the page edge cuts reads as the app itself. The component uses margin (not transform) to achieve this, forcing the neighboring column to surrender space. It is only meaningful when used inside a container with `overflow-x: clip` to prevent the overhang from widening the document.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-div**: Component MUST render a single `div` element.
- **accept-children**: Component MUST render all content passed via the `children` prop into the `div`.
- **accept-side-prop**: Component MUST accept a `side` prop with string values `"left"` or `"right"`, defaulting to `"right"`.
- **apply-base-class**: Component MUST apply the class `lp-bleed` to the rendered `div`.
- **side-class**: Component MUST apply a class `lp-bleed--{side}` to the rendered `div`, where `{side}` is the value of the `side` prop.
- **accept-class-name-prop**: Component MUST accept an optional `className` prop and append it to the rendered `div`.
- **falsy-class-filter**: Component MUST NOT output empty strings or undefined values in the class list; falsy class names MUST be filtered before joining.
- **side-passthrough**: `side` is typed `'left' | 'right'`; the component performs no runtime check, so a value outside that type (reachable only by a caller that bypasses TypeScript) MUST still render as `lp-bleed--{value}` verbatim. This is unenforced, undefined-by-the-type-system behavior, not a supported input.

## Appearance

- **Layout mechanism**: The component applies no inline styling itself; the crop's margin, direction, and distance are entirely defined by the `lp-bleed` and `lp-bleed--{side}` CSS classes (declared in the landing package's stylesheet, not in `Bleed.tsx`).
- **Mechanism, not magnitude**: Per the **Margin over transform** design decision, the crop is achieved with `margin`, not `transform`, so the neighboring column surrenders space. The component's own contract stops at applying the class names; the exact margin distance and any narrow-width behavior belong to those CSS classes, not to this component.
- **Clipping dependency**: The overhang only reads as "cropped" rather than "widening the page" when rendered inside an ancestor with `overflow-x: clip` — see the **Missing clipping parent** edge case and the `Band` ingredient (`agenticdevelopertoolkit://recipes/band`).

## States

Not applicable: Bleed is a static layout component with no interactive states (pressed, focused, disabled, etc.). It does not respond to user input or change state based on application logic.

## Accessibility

Bleed itself renders a generic, role-less `div` and makes no accessibility-tree changes; assistive-technology behavior is otherwise inherited entirely from `children`. However, because the component's purpose is to let content run into a visually clipped page edge:

- **No essential content in the crop**: Content placed in the bled region SHOULD be decorative only. Because the overhang is cropped by the ancestor's `overflow-x: clip`, essential text or an interactive control placed there risks being visually cut off, even where it may remain present in the accessibility tree.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| bleed-001 | render-div | `<Bleed>Content</Bleed>` | Renders a `div` element containing "Content" |
| bleed-002 | apply-base-class | `<Bleed>Content</Bleed>` | Rendered `div` has class `lp-bleed` |
| bleed-003 | side-class, accept-side-prop | `<Bleed side="left">Content</Bleed>` | Rendered `div` has class `lp-bleed--left` |
| bleed-004 | side-class, accept-side-prop | `<Bleed side="right">Content</Bleed>` | Rendered `div` has class `lp-bleed--right` |
| bleed-005 | accept-side-prop | `<Bleed>Content</Bleed>` (no side prop) | Rendered `div` has class `lp-bleed--right` (default) |
| bleed-006 | accept-class-name-prop | `<Bleed className="custom">Content</Bleed>` | Rendered `div` has classes `lp-bleed`, `lp-bleed--right`, `custom` |
| bleed-007 | falsy-class-filter, accept-class-name-prop | `<Bleed className="">Content</Bleed>` | Rendered `div` has classes `lp-bleed`, `lp-bleed--right` (empty className excluded) |
| bleed-008 | accept-children | `<Bleed><span>Text</span><button>Click</button></Bleed>` | Rendered `div` contains both `span` and `button` elements |
| bleed-009 | accept-children | `<Bleed>{null}</Bleed>` | Renders successfully with no content (`null` child) |
| bleed-010 | side-passthrough | `<Bleed side={'center' as unknown as 'left' \| 'right'}>Content</Bleed>` | Rendered `div` has class `lp-bleed--center` |
| bleed-011 | accept-class-name-prop | `<Bleed className="custom-one custom-two">Content</Bleed>` | Rendered `div` has classes `lp-bleed`, `lp-bleed--right`, `custom-one custom-two` (space-separated value appended as-is) |
| bleed-012 | accept-children | `<Bleed><>Content</></Bleed>` | Rendered `div` contains "Content" (fragment's children render inside the `div`) |

## Edge Cases

- **Empty children**: `<Bleed>{null}</Bleed>` renders the `div` with no content; see **accept-children** (bleed-009).
- **Null or undefined `className`**: excluded from the class list before joining; see **falsy-class-filter** (bleed-007).
- **Side values outside the typed union**: the component renders whatever string is passed with no validation; see **side-passthrough** (bleed-010).
- **Multiple class names in `className`**: a space-separated value (e.g. `"custom-one custom-two"`) is appended as-is, unmodified; see **accept-class-name-prop** (bleed-011).
- **React.Fragment as child**: `<Bleed><>Content</></Bleed>` is valid; the fragment's children render inside the `div`; see **accept-children** (bleed-012).
- **Missing clipping parent**: if Bleed is not rendered inside an ancestor with `overflow-x: clip` (e.g. `.lp-band`; see the `Band` ingredient, `agenticdevelopertoolkit://recipes/band`), the overhang widens the document instead of appearing cropped. This is an environmental prerequisite that Bleed cannot detect or enforce on its own.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `side` | `'left' \| 'right'` | `'right'` | Direction toward which to extend the child element past the content column |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Required. Child content to render inside the bleed container |
| `className` | `string` | `undefined` | Optional. Additional CSS class names to apply to the rendered `div` |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: Bleed is a layout component with no deep-linking behavior or URL state. It is a presentation wrapper, not a navigable destination.

## Localization

Not applicable: Bleed contains no text strings or localizable content. It is a layout wrapper that renders whatever content is passed via `children`.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: Bleed is a layout wrapper that does not respond to accessibility display options (e.g., Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast). Any accessibility options affecting the content are handled by the rendered children, not by Bleed itself.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: The component source contains no feature flag logic or conditional rendering based on configuration flags.

## Analytics

Not applicable: The component source includes no event tracking, analytics collection, or telemetry instrumentation.

## Privacy

Not applicable: Bleed collects no data, stores no state, and transmits no information. It is a stateless layout component.

## Logging

Not applicable: The component source contains no logging or debug output.

## Platform Notes

- **Web (React/TypeScript)**: Source file is `Bleed.tsx` in the landing package. The component renders a `div` with class names joined from `['lp-bleed', `lp-bleed--${side}`, className]` after filtering falsy values. It accepts `side`, `children`, and `className` as props. The component relies on a parent container with `overflow-x: clip` (e.g., `.lp-band`) to prevent the overhang from widening the document.

- **SwiftUI**: Implement a custom `Layout` (the `Layout` protocol) that reports extra width toward the bleed edge, or apply a negative `.padding()` on the given side so the child pushes into the neighboring column the way CSS `margin` does. Do not use `.offset()`: it repositions the view visually without reclaiming layout space from siblings, which is exactly the transform-based approach the **Margin over transform** design decision rejects. Clip the ancestor with `.clipped()` to match `overflow-x: clip`.

- **Compose**: Implement with a custom `Layout` composable (or `Modifier.layout`) that measures the child wider than its slot and places it offset toward the bleed edge, so the sibling composables are actually pushed aside. `Modifier.offset()` / `absoluteOffset()` alone only repositions the child without affecting the measured layout, so it does not reproduce the effect. Clip the ancestor with `Modifier.clipToBounds()` to match `overflow-x: clip`. The `side` parameter maps to which edge the extra measured width is added toward.

- **AppKit / UIKit**: Implement a custom view (subclass of `NSView` or `UIView`) that uses a negative leading/trailing Auto Layout constraint (or a negative frame margin) on the given side so the child's layout genuinely extends past the content column — the same role CSS `margin` plays. A positioning transform would move the view visually without giving up the space, so it does not qualify. Use `clipsToBounds` on the parent to crop the overhang, equivalent to `overflow-x: clip`.

- **WinUI 3**: Implement using a `Grid` or custom `Panel` with a negative `Margin` on the given side (`Margin.Left` or `Margin.Right`) so the child's layout slot genuinely extends past the content column. Set `UIElement.Clip` to a `RectangleGeometry` on the parent to crop the overhang, equivalent to `overflow-x: clip`. WinUI 3 has no `Clipping` property, and `Grid.Column` is unrelated to this effect — `UIElement.Clip` plus a negative `Margin` is the real mechanism.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: Use CSS `margin` rather than CSS `transform` to extend the child element past the content column.
**Rationale**: `margin` forces the neighboring column to surrender space, creating the intended visual hierarchy; a `transform` would move the element visually without affecting layout, leaving space in the neighboring column and defeating the "crop by viewport" effect.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Filter out falsy class names (empty strings, `null`, `undefined`) before joining the class list.
**Rationale**: Prevents unintended class concatenation (e.g., a stray double space from an empty `className`) and keeps the rendered class list clean.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Do not validate that `side` is one of the expected values (`'left'` or `'right'`).
**Rationale**: Passing an invalid value renders a class like `lp-bleed--invalid` as-is (see **side-passthrough**). This delegates validation to the caller and keeps the component simple; TypeScript's `'left' | 'right'` type covers the supported surface, and a value outside it means the caller has bypassed the type.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Assume Bleed is rendered inside a container with `overflow-x: clip` (e.g. `.lp-band`, see the `Band` ingredient).
**Rationale**: Without that ancestor clipping, the overhang widens the document instead of appearing cropped, defeating the visual intent; enforcing it inside Bleed itself is not possible without coupling Bleed to a specific parent component.
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [semantic-markup](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#semantic-markup) | passed | Accessibility |
| [keyboard-navigable](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#keyboard-navigable) | partial | Accessibility |

The source renders a plain, role-less `div` with no ARIA misuse (semantic-markup); it performs no check on whether the region it crops still leaves focusable content reachable, so that depends entirely on the caller keeping the bled area decorative-only (keyboard-navigable, see **Accessibility**).
