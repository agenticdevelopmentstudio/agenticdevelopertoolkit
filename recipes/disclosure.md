# Disclosure

## Overview

**Disclosure** is a self-contained collapsible section: a clickable header row
with a rotating chevron that shows or hides its children, themed with the family
`apt-*` tokens. It is uncontrolled by default (`defaultOpen`) but accepts
`open`/`onOpenChange` to be driven by a caller. The header can carry trailing
`actions` that do not toggle the section — useful for per-section buttons (e.g.
a section's own danger-zone action).

## Behavioral Requirements

- **toggle-on-header-click**: Clicking the header toggle MUST flip the visibility of the children.
- **support-uncontrolled**: With `defaultOpen` and no `open` prop, the component MUST manage its own open state.
- **support-controlled**: When `open` is provided, the component MUST reflect that prop and report intent via `onOpenChange`, without mutating internal state.
- **rotate-chevron**: The leading chevron MUST rotate 90° when open and return when closed.
- **actions-exempt-from-toggle**: Interacting with the header `actions` slot MUST NOT toggle the disclosure.
- **mount-children-only-when-open**: Children MUST be mounted only when open (and unmounted when closed), not merely visually hidden.
- **expose-expanded-state**: The toggle button MUST carry `aria-expanded` reflecting the current open state.

## Appearance

Container: `rounded-lg border border-apt-border bg-apt-surface`. Header:
`flex items-center gap-2 px-3 py-2`; the toggle is a `<button>` showing a
`ChevronRight` that gains `rotate-90` when open, a `text-sm font-medium
text-apt-text` title and an optional `text-xs text-apt-text-muted` subtitle (both
truncate). `actions` are pinned to the right. The open body is separated by
`border-t border-apt-border px-3 py-3`. Focus ring `apt-gold/40`. No raw hex; no
`!important`. The chevron's rotation is animated with the `transition-transform`
class; no `motion-reduce:` variant is applied, so the rotation does not defer to
the reduced-motion preference (see Compliance).

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|---|---|
| collapsed | chevron points right; children unmounted |
| expanded | chevron rotated 90°; children shown under a top border |
| header focus | `focus-visible` ring on the toggle button |

## Accessibility

The header toggle is a real `<button>` carrying `aria-expanded` that reflects the
open state (**expose-expanded-state**), with a visible `focus-visible` ring. As a
native `<button>`, the toggle is reachable via Tab and activatable via Enter or
Space without extra wiring (**toggle-on-header-click**). The `actions` slot sits
outside the toggle button, so its controls are independently reachable and do not
trigger the toggle.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | toggle-on-header-click | click the header | children show, then hide |
| T2 | support-uncontrolled | `defaultOpen` only | manages its own state |
| T3 | support-controlled | `open={false}` and an `onOpenChange` that ignores the call; click the header | callback fires once; children stay unmounted |
| T4 | rotate-chevron | open it | chevron gains `rotate-90` |
| T5 | actions-exempt-from-toggle | click a button in `actions` | disclosure state unchanged |
| T6 | mount-children-only-when-open | collapsed | children absent from the DOM |
| T7 | toggle-on-header-click | Enter/Space on the focused header | children show, then hide |
| T8 | expose-expanded-state | inspect the toggle button after opening and closing | `aria-expanded` matches the current open state |

## Edge Cases

- In controlled mode the component never writes internal state — the caller owns `open`.
- `actions` are rendered outside the toggle `<button>`, so a click there cannot bubble into a toggle.
- Title and subtitle both truncate to keep the header a single row.
- Because children unmount when collapsed (**mount-children-only-when-open**), any uncommitted state inside them — e.g. a half-filled form — is discarded when the section closes, and they start fresh when it reopens.

## Configuration

Props: `title`, `subtitle?`, `actions?`, `defaultOpen?` (false), `open?`,
`onOpenChange?`, `className?`, `headerClassName?`, `children`. Export:
`Disclosure`.

## Logging

None — a presentational primitive. Callers own any open/close telemetry.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: `DisclosureGroup` already supplies its own chevron and an `isExpanded:` binding for controlled mode — use it directly, or build an equivalent with `@State` for toggle state and `.rotationEffect(.degrees(isOpen ? 90 : 0))` for the chevron.
- **Compose**: `var expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }` for toggle state, a chevron `Icon` with `Modifier.rotate(if (expanded) 90f else 0f)`, and `if (expanded) { content() }` so the body unmounts when collapsed.
- **React/Web**: `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/disclosure.tsx`. Uses lucide `ChevronRight` icon for the toggle chevron. Marked `"use client"` for Next.js server components. Respects Tailwind theme tokens (`apt-*` family). Header truncates rather than wrapping; verify responsive behavior via Playwright at 375 / 768 / 1440.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: AppKit — an `NSButton` with `bezelStyle = .disclosure`, adding or removing the content view on toggle. UIKit — a `UIButton` toggling by adding or removing the content view as an arranged subview of a `UIStackView`.
- **WinUI 3**: the stock `Expander` puts its chevron on the trailing edge and flips it 180°, keeps collapsed content in the visual tree, and its `Expanding`/`Collapsing` events don't carry controlled-mode intent — following it as-is breaks **rotate-chevron** and **mount-children-only-when-open**. Either re-template `Expander` (leading chevron, `RotateTransform` at 90°, content set to `null` when collapsed) or build a custom `ToggleButton` + `ContentPresenter` pair that sets `Content` to `null` on collapse.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: Support both controlled and uncontrolled open state, via an optional `open`/`onOpenChange` pair layered over an internal `useState`.
**Rationale**: Simple cases need no wiring; callers that must observe or drive the state can pass `open`/`onOpenChange` instead.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Render `actions` outside the toggle `<button>`.
**Rationale**: Per-section buttons stay in the header without toggling the section, avoiding a surprise state change when a user clicks an action (principle of least astonishment).
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Unmount collapsed children instead of hiding them.
**Rationale**: Collapsed children leave the DOM so they hold no hidden tab stops; the trade-off is that any uncommitted state inside them resets each time the section closes (see Edge Cases).
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Implement the toggle as a hand-rolled `<button>` with conditional rendering rather than native `<details>`/`<summary>`.
**Rationale**: The component must support a fully controlled mode that reflects an external `open` prop without mutating internal state, and must unmount rather than hide its children when closed; native `<details>` ties its open state to the DOM `open` attribute and keeps collapsed content in the tree, which fights both requirements without extra imperative sync code.
**Approved**: pending

Statuses rest on `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/disclosure.tsx`: the real `<button>` with `aria-expanded` and native keyboard semantics ground the passed and partial accessibility checks, the unconditional `transition-transform` with no `motion-reduce:` variant grounds the failed reduced-motion check, the consumer-supplied `title`/`subtitle`/`children` props ground the passed internationalization checks, and the `truncate` classes with no leading-chevron RTL mirroring ground the failed and partial internationalization checks.
