# Field

## Overview

The shared `Field` in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui` — the family's standard form row. It stacks
an uppercase-mono caption above whatever control it wraps (`Input`, `Select`,
`Switch`, `Textarea`, or any other primitive passed as `children`), and it renders
the whole row inside the shared `Label` so the caption is **implicitly associated**
with the control: clicking the caption focuses the input, with no `htmlFor`/`id`
wiring at the call site.

Below the control, `Field` renders one line of supporting text: a dim-mono `hint`
by default, or a red-mono `error` that takes the hint's place when present. This is
the one place inline field errors live, so forms across the platform stop
re-implementing (and re-styling) their own error text.

`Field` is presentation-only: it owns no value, no validation, and no state. The
caller supplies the control, the `hint`, and the `error`; `Field` only decides the
layout and which supporting line to show.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **must-render-caption**: The field MUST render the `label` node as an
  uppercase-mono caption (the shared `fieldCaptionClass`) above its control.
- **must-associate-label-implicitly**: The field MUST wrap the caption and the
  control in a single shared `Label` so activating the caption focuses the control,
  without the caller supplying `htmlFor`/`id`.
- **must-render-control**: The field MUST render its `children` (the control)
  between the caption and the supporting line.
- **must-show-hint-when-no-error**: When `error` is unset and `hint` is provided,
  the field MUST render `hint` below the control in dim mono.
- **must-show-error-in-place-of-hint**: When `error` is set, the field MUST render
  `error` below the control in red mono and MUST NOT also render `hint`.
- **must-omit-supporting-line-when-empty**: When neither `error` nor `hint` is
  provided, the field MUST render no supporting line below the control.
- **must-merge-classname**: The field MUST merge a caller-supplied `className` onto
  its root without dropping its own layout classes.

## Appearance

```
LABEL CAPTION            ← uppercase mono, apt-text-muted (fieldCaptionClass)
┌───────────────────────┐
│  control (children)    │ ← Input / Select / Switch / Textarea / …
└───────────────────────┘
helper text below         ← hint: dim mono (apt-text-dim)
                          ← OR error: red mono (apt-red), replacing the hint
```

- Root: the shared `Label` as a vertical stack — `flex flex-col items-start
  gap-1.5` — so caption, control, and supporting line left-align in a column.
- Caption: `fieldCaptionClass` = `font-mono text-[0.7rem] uppercase tracking-wider
  text-apt-text-muted` (the platform's one caption treatment).
- Hint: `font-mono text-[0.7rem] text-apt-text-dim`.
- Error: `font-mono text-[0.7rem] text-apt-red` — same metrics as the hint, red
  tone, occupying the same slot.
- No raw hex; no `!important`; every color is an `apt-*` token.

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|---|---|
| Default (hint only) | caption, control, then dim-mono `hint` |
| Default (no hint, no error) | caption + control only; no supporting line |
| Error | caption, control, then red-mono `error`; the `hint` is suppressed |
| Focused control | caption + control focus is the control's own affordance; `Field` adds none |
| Disabled control | the wrapping `Label` dims via `peer-disabled` when the control marks itself a `peer` |

## Accessibility

- The caption and control share one `<label>` element, so the caption is a real,
  programmatic label for the control — clicking it focuses the control and screen
  readers announce the caption when the control is focused.
- The caption text is authored by the caller; it MUST be human-readable label text
  (implicit association carries no `aria-label`).
- The error line is plain text in the label's flow, so it is read with the field;
  callers that need assertive announcement SHOULD add their own `role="alert"`
  wrapper around the message they pass as `error`.
- Color is not the only error signal in practice — the message text itself states
  the error — but callers SHOULD keep error copy meaningful for non-visual users.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | must-render-caption, must-associate-label-implicitly | `<Field label="Name"><input/></Field>` | One `<label>` wraps an uppercase-mono "Name" caption and the input; clicking the caption focuses the input |
| T2 | must-render-control | `children` is an `<Input/>` | The input renders between the caption and any supporting line |
| T3 | must-show-hint-when-no-error | `hint="Shown to teammates"`, no `error` | A dim-mono hint line renders below the control |
| T4 | must-show-error-in-place-of-hint | `hint="…"` AND `error="Required"` | A red-mono "Required" renders; the hint is absent |
| T5 | must-omit-supporting-line-when-empty | neither `hint` nor `error` | No supporting line renders below the control |
| T6 | must-merge-classname | `className="mt-4"` | Root keeps `flex flex-col …` and adds `mt-4` |

## Edge Cases

- Both `hint` and `error` set → `error` wins and the hint is not rendered (the
  error occupies the hint's slot, so the row height does not jump).
- `error` toggling on/off swaps the single supporting line rather than stacking two
  lines, so validated forms don't reflow by an extra row.
- `label` is a `ReactNode`, so a caption may include an inline glyph or badge; it is
  still rendered with the caption treatment.
- Empty-string `hint`/`error` renders nothing (falsy), same as omitting it.
- The control is whatever `children` the caller passes; `Field` imposes no control
  type and forwards no value/validation.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | `ReactNode` | — (required) | The caption text, rendered uppercase-mono above the control. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — (required) | The control (e.g. `Input`/`Select`/`Switch`/`Textarea`). |
| `hint` | `ReactNode` | — | Dim-mono helper line below the control; shown only when `error` is unset. |
| `error` | `ReactNode` | — | Red-mono inline error; when set, replaces `hint` in the same slot. |
| `errorId` | `string` | — | Names the error line for a control that points `aria-describedby` at it. |
| `layout` | `"stacked" \| "inline"` | `"stacked"` | Caption above the control (default) or beside it in a fixed-width right-aligned column for grouped rows. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes merged onto the root `Label` via `cn()`. |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: Field is a presentational primitive without its own routing or deep-link targets.

## Localization

Not applicable: Field renders whatever caption and error text the caller provides; localization belongs to the caller and the form owning the field.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: Field's mono treatment (caption, hint, error) does not respond to display preferences like reduced motion or increased contrast; the control nested inside may do so, but that is independent of Field.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: Field is a core presentational block with no feature flag.

## Analytics

Not applicable: Field is presentation-only and forwards no events or telemetry; analytics belong to the control and the owning form.

## Privacy

Not applicable: Field renders layout and labels supplied by the caller; it collects no user data.

## Logging

No logging. `Field` is a presentational primitive; value changes, validation, and
any telemetry belong to the control and the owning form, not to `Field`.

## Platform Notes

- **React / Web (TypeScript):** `packages/web/packages/ui/src/blocks/field.tsx`, exported via `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks/field`. Composes the shared `Label` (`components/label`) and the `fieldCaptionClass` from `lib/typography`. The `inline` layout uses CSS Grid with `--apt-field-label-w` custom property for label column width; stacked layout is a vertical flexbox. Server-safe with no `"use client"` directive.

- **SwiftUI:** Compose this using `VStack` for stacked layout, wrapping the label text and control in a `LabeledContent` where the label is capitalized and set to a consistent `.caption` size, then render hint or error text in a secondary `.caption2` style below. For inline layout, use `HStack` with fixed-width label column and `Spacer` for flex fill. Substitute SwiftUI's `@Environment(\.isEnabled)` for peer-disabled behavior.

- **Compose (Kotlin):** Build with `Column` for stacked layout, applying the platform's `Typography.labelSmall` to caption text in uppercase, then nest the control followed by hint or error in a `Text` with reduced opacity. For inline layout, switch to a `Row` with `weight(1f)` modifier on the control column. Use `Modifier.alpha()` or `enabled` parameter for disabled dimming.

- **AppKit / UIKit:** On iOS, compose with `UIStackView` axis `.vertical` or `.horizontal` (for inline), apply system font `.caption1` to the label, render as a tappable `UIButton` with `systemBlue` title color if not disabled, and use a secondary label for hint/error text. On macOS, use `NSStackView` with similar treatment; consider `NSTextField` for the label if click-to-focus is not needed. Both platforms should implement peer-disabled by graying the stack's `isEnabled` or individual control alpha.

- **WinUI 3:** Use `StackPanel` orientation `Vertical` (stacked) or `Horizontal` (inline) as root; render the label as a `TextBlock` with `FontWeight.SemiBold`, `FontSize=12`, uppercase text, and `Foreground` bound to `SystemControlForegroundBaseBrush` (or design token equivalent). For inline, give the label a fixed `Width="104"` and right-align via `HorizontalAlignment="Right"`. Below or beside the control, add a secondary `TextBlock` for hint (dimmed via `SystemControlDisabledBaseBrush`) or error (red via `ErrorTextBrush` or similar semantically-named brush). Bind `StackPanel.IsEnabled` or individual control `IsEnabled` to achieve the disabled state dimming; WinUI 3 applies opacity automatically when controls are disabled.

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: Wrap the whole row in one shared `Label` rather than pairing an
  `htmlFor`/`id`. **Rationale**: Implicit association removes per-call id wiring and
  makes the caption a real click target, while keeping every caption on the one
  `fieldCaptionClass` treatment.
- **Decision**: `error` occupies the same slot as `hint` (one supporting line, not
  two). **Rationale**: The row height stays stable as validation toggles, and forms
  get a single, consistent place for inline errors instead of re-inventing error
  text.
- **Decision**: `Field` owns no value or validation. **Rationale**: It stays a
  reusable layout primitive over any control; optimize-for-change keeps validation
  policy in the form, not the row.
- **Decision**: Caption and error are mono at the same `0.7rem` metrics.
  **Rationale**: Error and hint read as the same "supporting text" rhythm, differing
  only by the `apt-red` tone that signals the error.
- **Decision**: `layout` prop controls caption placement (stacked above or inline beside).
  **Rationale**: Grouped inline forms (e.g., categories and tags rows) align captions
  by sharing the `--apt-field-label-w` custom property, reducing per-call coupling
  while keeping the default stacked layout simple and no-config.
