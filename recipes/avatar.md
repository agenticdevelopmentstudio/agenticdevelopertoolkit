# Avatar

## Overview

`Avatar` is the shared avatar ingredient in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui`: a thin,
three-part wrapper around Base UI's `Avatar` primitive (`@base-ui/react/avatar`),
the reference implementation for this ingredient's delegated behavior. It exports
`Avatar` (wraps `Avatar.Root`), `AvatarImage` (wraps `Avatar.Image`), and
`AvatarFallback` (wraps `Avatar.Fallback`). Each wrapper's only job is to apply
one of the semantic classes `adh-avatar`, `adh-avatar__image`, or
`adh-avatar__fallback` (merged with any consumer-supplied `className`) and
forward every other prop unchanged to the underlying Base UI primitive. The
module is a client component (`'use client'`). The source comment at
`avatar.tsx` documents why the class names must stay stable: "Base UI
avatar styled through the SEMANTIC `adh-avatar*` classes (skinned in
`../styles/components.css`): the class names are a public theming surface for
the theme editor and user CSS themes, so they stay stable hooks in the DOM."

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-root-with-semantic-class**: `Avatar` MUST render Base UI's `Avatar.Root` (`AvatarPrimitive.Root`) with the class name `adh-avatar` applied.
- **render-image-with-semantic-class**: `AvatarImage` MUST render Base UI's `Avatar.Image` (`AvatarPrimitive.Image`) with the class name `adh-avatar__image` applied.
- **render-fallback-with-semantic-class**: `AvatarFallback` MUST render Base UI's `Avatar.Fallback` (`AvatarPrimitive.Fallback`) with the class name `adh-avatar__fallback` applied.

These three class names are the public theming surface quoted in Overview — stable DOM hooks consumed by the theme editor and user CSS themes — so renaming any of `adh-avatar`, `adh-avatar__image`, or `adh-avatar__fallback` is a breaking change for every theme built against them, not a local refactor.

- **merge-consumer-classname**: Each of `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` MUST merge a consumer-supplied `className` prop with its own semantic class name (via the `cn` helper imported from `../lib/utils`) rather than dropping either class.
- **forward-remaining-props**: Each of `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` MUST forward every prop other than `className` unchanged to its underlying Base UI primitive.
- **load-as-client-module**: The module MUST be marked `'use client'`, so `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` render as client components. This is verified by a static check for the `'use client'` directive at the top of `avatar.tsx`, not by a runtime conformance test vector.

## Appearance

Not applicable: Component applies only semantic class names; styling values are defined externally in `../styles/components.css` and are outside this wrapper's scope.

## States

Not applicable: Component is a stateless rendering wrapper; interactive state management is delegated to Base UI's Avatar primitives.

## Accessibility

The wrapper adds no accessibility defaults of its own — it forwards every prop unchanged — so these obligations fall on the consumer:

- **Required `alt`**: `AvatarImage` forwards `alt` unchanged to Base UI's `Avatar.Image`, which renders it on the underlying `<img>`; consumers MUST supply a meaningful `alt` value, since the wrapper performs no validation or default of its own.
- **Decorative fallback**: `AvatarFallback` forwards `children` unchanged to Base UI's `Avatar.Fallback` with no default `aria-hidden`; consumers SHOULD mark fallback content `aria-hidden="true"` when it is purely decorative (e.g., initials that duplicate a name already shown as text elsewhere), to avoid a redundant screen-reader announcement.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| avatar-001 | render-root-with-semantic-class | Render `<Avatar />` with no props | Rendered root element has class `adh-avatar` |
| avatar-002 | render-image-with-semantic-class | Render `<Avatar><AvatarImage src="<1x1 stub already loaded>" /></Avatar>` | Rendered image element has class `adh-avatar__image` |
| avatar-003 | render-fallback-with-semantic-class | Render `<AvatarFallback />` with no props | Rendered fallback element has class `adh-avatar__fallback` |
| avatar-004 | merge-consumer-classname | Render `<Avatar className="ring-2" />` | Rendered root element has both `adh-avatar` and `ring-2` classes |
| avatar-005 | merge-consumer-classname | Render `<Avatar><AvatarImage className="opacity-0" src="<1x1 stub already loaded>" /></Avatar>` | Rendered image element has both `adh-avatar__image` and `opacity-0` classes |
| avatar-006 | merge-consumer-classname | Render `<AvatarFallback className="bg-muted" />` | Rendered fallback element has both `adh-avatar__fallback` and `bg-muted` classes |
| avatar-007 | forward-remaining-props | Render `<Avatar data-testid="a1" />` | Rendered root element carries `data-testid="a1"` |
| avatar-008 | forward-remaining-props | Render `<Avatar><AvatarImage alt="Ada Lovelace" src="<1x1 stub already loaded>" /></Avatar>` | Rendered image element carries `alt="Ada Lovelace"` |

## Edge Cases

- **Null/empty `className`**: `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` MUST still render when `className` is omitted (`undefined`), passing `undefined` as the second argument to `cn`; the wrapper performs no validation of `className` before doing so.
- **No other props supplied**: `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` MUST render correctly when called with no props beyond (or including) `className`, since `{...props}` is spread unconditionally and the wrapper performs no required-prop checking of its own.
- **Boundary values**: Not applicable: Component defines no numeric, length, or size-constrained props of its own (e.g. no `size`, `min`, `max`); any such constraints belong to the underlying Base UI `Avatar.Root`/`Image`/`Fallback` API.
- **Concurrent access**: Not applicable: `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` are stateless functional components with no internal state, refs, or module-level mutable data; each render is an independent, pure function call.
- **Error states**: `AvatarImage` MUST unmount when its underlying `<img>` fails to load, which is what reveals `AvatarFallback`; this load-failure-to-fallback handoff is Base UI's `Avatar.Image`/`Avatar.Fallback` behavior (`@base-ui/react/avatar`), not logic this wrapper adds.
- **Offline or disconnected state**: `AvatarImage` MUST fall back the same way whether a load failure is caused by an offline network or any other image-load error, because Base UI's Avatar has no separate retry or timeout path for network failures — a failed load unmounts `Avatar.Image` and reveals `Avatar.Fallback` exactly as in Error states above.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `className` (on `Avatar`) | `string \| undefined` | `undefined` | Extra class merged with `adh-avatar` via `cn`. |
| `className` (on `AvatarImage`) | `string \| undefined` | `undefined` | Extra class merged with `adh-avatar__image` via `cn`. |
| `className` (on `AvatarFallback`) | `string \| undefined` | `undefined` | Extra class merged with `adh-avatar__fallback` via `cn`. |
| `...props` (on `Avatar`) | `AvatarPrimitive.Root.Props`, minus `className` | — | Forwarded unchanged to Base UI's `Avatar.Root`. |
| `...props` (on `AvatarImage`) | `AvatarPrimitive.Image.Props`, minus `className` | — | Forwarded unchanged to Base UI's `Avatar.Image`. |
| `...props` (on `AvatarFallback`) | `AvatarPrimitive.Fallback.Props`, minus `className` | — | Forwarded unchanged to Base UI's `Avatar.Fallback`. |

The wrapper forwards all other props to the underlying Base UI primitives unchanged. See `@base-ui/react/avatar` for the exhaustive `Avatar.Root.Props`, `Avatar.Image.Props`, and `Avatar.Fallback.Props` type definitions.

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: Component has no URL routing or deep linking logic.

## Localization

Not applicable: Component has no user-facing strings or localization concerns.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: Component does not respond to platform accessibility display options.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: Component has no feature flag logic.

## Analytics

Not applicable: Component performs no analytics tracking.

## Privacy

- **Data collected**: None. `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` perform no data collection of their own; they render whatever `src`/`children`/props a consumer supplies.
- **Storage**: None. This file contains no persistence logic.
- **Transmission**: Not applicable: Component has no transmission logic; any network requests for image loading are delegated to Base UI's `Avatar.Image` implementation.
- **Retention**: None. This file has no caching or retention logic of its own.

## Logging

Not applicable: Component performs no logging.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: Start with `Image` and `Text` views in a container (e.g., `ZStack` or `Group`). SwiftUI has no built-in Avatar primitive, so composition is manual. Differs from web in requiring explicit state logic to toggle image visibility when loading or on error; web Avatar delegates this to Base UI's fallback reveal.
- **Compose**: Start with Coil's `AsyncImage` or standard `Image` composable for the image and a `Text` composable for fallback initials. Kotlin/Jetpack Compose has no built-in Avatar primitive, so composition is manual. Differs from web in requiring explicit error handling and fallback reveal within the composable; web delegates this to Base UI.
- **React/Web**: `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` (`packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/avatar.tsx`) wrap Base UI's `Avatar.Root`, `Avatar.Image`, and `Avatar.Fallback` (`@base-ui/react/avatar`), applying the semantic classes `adh-avatar`, `adh-avatar__image`, and `adh-avatar__fallback` (skinned in `../styles/components.css`) merged with any consumer `className`, and forwarding all other props. The module is a client component (`'use client'`).
- **AppKit / UIKit**: Start with `NSImageView` (macOS) or `UIImageView` (iOS) for the image and `NSTextField`/`UILabel` or button for fallback initials. AppKit/UIKit have no built-in Avatar primitive, so composition is manual. Differs from web in requiring explicit visibility toggling and layout constraints; web Avatar delegates image-with-fallback reveal to Base UI.
- **WinUI 3**: A Windows developer would start from `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.PersonPicture`, the built-in WinUI 3 avatar control, since it natively provides the same image-with-initials-fallback contract that `Avatar`/`AvatarImage`/`AvatarFallback` compose from three separate Base UI primitives. The key difference: `PersonPicture` bakes the image/fallback decision into one control (via its `ProfilePicture`, `Initials`, and `DisplayName` properties) rather than exposing three independently composable Root/Image/Fallback pieces, so it cannot be skinned through three discrete semantic classes the way `adh-avatar`/`adh-avatar__image`/`adh-avatar__fallback` are; matching this ingredient's exact three-part composition on Windows instead requires a custom control built from an `Image` plus a `TextBlock` inside a `Border`/`Grid`, since WinUI 3 has no direct Root/Image/Fallback primitive split.

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: Keep the class names `adh-avatar`, `adh-avatar__image`, and `adh-avatar__fallback` exactly as they are, rather than treating them as ordinary, freely-renameable implementation classes.
  **Rationale**: The source comment quoted in Overview documents them as a public theming surface for the theme editor and user CSS themes; renaming any of the three is a breaking change for every theme built against them, not a local refactor. This is the stability note attached to `render-root-with-semantic-class`, `render-image-with-semantic-class`, and `render-fallback-with-semantic-class`.
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` add no logic beyond class assignment and prop forwarding.
  **Rationale**: Loading/error/fallback-reveal behavior, ARIA semantics, and any interactive states are owned entirely by Base UI's `Avatar` primitive (`@base-ui/react/avatar`), delegated to deliberately to keep this wrapper stateless and composable.
  **Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [dynamic-type-support](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#dynamic-type-support) | partial | Accessibility |
| [contrast-ratio](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#contrast-ratio) | partial | Accessibility |
| [semantic-markup](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#semantic-markup) | partial | Accessibility |
| [text-expansion-tolerance](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/internationalization#text-expansion-tolerance) | partial | Internationalization |
| [unicode-support](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/internationalization#unicode-support) | passed | Internationalization |

`unicode-support` passes because `AvatarFallback` forwards `children` unprocessed with no string manipulation of its own. `dynamic-type-support`, `contrast-ratio`, and `semantic-markup` are partial because sizing, color, and font scaling are defined externally in `../styles/components.css`, and ARIA semantics are owned by Base UI's `Avatar.Root`/`Image`/`Fallback` — none of which this wrapper's source can confirm. `text-expansion-tolerance` is partial because the wrapper imposes no width constraint of its own on fallback text, but the source also cannot show whether a caller-constrained layout truncates expanded text.
