# Trust

## Overview

The Trust component renders a semantic unordered list of trust claims—things a visitor wants settled before reading product capabilities. It accepts an array of React nodes and renders each as a list item, deliberately unstyled to avoid elevating claims to the visual prominence of product features.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **list-structure**: Component MUST render the `items` array as a semantic unordered list: a `<ul>` container with each item wrapped in a distinct `<li>` element.
- **node-items**: Component MUST accept `items` as a `ReactNode[]` prop, supporting text, React elements, fragments, and null values; every entry maps to an `<li>` in order, including `null`/`undefined` entries, which render as an empty `<li>` rather than being skipped.
- **container-class**: Component MUST apply the className `lp-trust` to the rendered `<ul>` element.

## Appearance

- **Container**: Semantic `<ul>` element with className `lp-trust`; no inline styles. Visual treatment comes entirely from `packages/web/packages/landing/src/css/blocks.css`: a wrapping flex row (not a vertical stack), centered, small uppercase text (`0.72rem`, `0.14em` letter-spacing) in a dim ink color, with no border or box—lighter weight than `.lp-cards`.
- **Items**: `<li>` elements, each a flex row with a small 5px round accent-colored marker (`::before`) preceding the provided React node content; no other item-level styling.
- **Layout**: Items wrap left-to-right and center as a group (`flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center`), not stacked vertically; gap of `0.4rem` (row) by `1.5rem` (column) between items.

## States

Not applicable: The Trust component is a static container that does not respond to user input or exhibit interactive state changes.

## Accessibility

- **Role**: Semantic `<ul>` and `<li>` establish list structure; screen readers announce list length and each item's position.
- **Label requirements**: Individual items should provide meaningful content; if items contain interactive controls, they MUST include accessible labels or descriptions.
- **Keyboard navigation**: No interactive behavior in the container; keyboard access is inherited from item content.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| trust-001 | list-structure | `items={[<span>Claim A</span>, <span>Claim B</span>]}` | Renders `<ul class="lp-trust"><li><span>Claim A</span></li><li><span>Claim B</span></li></ul>` |
| trust-002 | list-structure | `items={[<span>Claim A</span>]}` | Rendered output contains exactly one `<ul>` element as the root, with no additional wrapping elements |
| trust-003 | container-class | `items={[<span>Claim A</span>]}` | Rendered `<ul>` has `class="lp-trust"` |
| trust-004 | node-items | `items={["Text", <Badge />, <span>Mixed</span>, null]}` | Renders one `<li>` for every entry, in order, including the `null` entry, which renders as an empty `<li>` |
| trust-005 | list-structure | `items={[]}` | Renders an empty `<ul class="lp-trust"></ul>` |

## Edge Cases

- **Empty array**: Component renders an empty `<ul>` with no error or fallback message.
- **Single item**: Component renders a `<ul>` containing one `<li>` child.
- **Null or undefined items**: The component does not filter these values—`items.map` renders one `<li>` per array entry regardless of content, so a `null` or `undefined` entry produces an empty `<li>` rather than being skipped.
- **Deeply nested React elements**: Component renders the full tree of each item without flattening or transforming structure.
- **Dynamic items**: Component re-renders when items array or item content changes; items are rendered in array order, not reordered by component logic. Items are keyed by array index (see **Design Decisions**), so reordering the array does not preserve an item's identity across renders.

## Configuration

Not applicable: The Trust component accepts only the `items` prop and provides no configuration options.

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: The Trust component is a presentational container with no navigation or routing behavior.

## Localization

Not applicable: The Trust component does not define, render, or own any translatable strings. Item content is the responsibility of consuming code.

## Accessibility Options

- **Reduce Motion**: Not applicable; component does not animate.
- **Increase Contrast**: Not applicable; component does not define foreground or background colors.
- **Differentiate Without Color**: Not applicable; component relies on semantic structure, not color-based distinctions.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: The Trust component has no feature flag requirements or runtime configuration switches.

## Analytics

Not applicable: The Trust component does not emit user interaction events or track engagement.

## Privacy

Not applicable: The Trust component does not collect, store, or transmit personal data.

## Logging

Not applicable: The Trust component does not emit diagnostic or debug log messages.

## Platform Notes

- **TypeScript/Web**: Render as `<ul className="lp-trust">` wrapping `<li>` children. See `packages/web/packages/landing/src/blocks/Trust.tsx`. Items are passed as `ReactNode[]` and rendered in order via `map()`, including `null`/`undefined` entries, which render as empty `<li>` elements.
- **SwiftUI**: Compose using a `VStack` (or `HStack`, matching the flex-row layout) with list semantics applied through accessibility traits (e.g. `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)`)—not `List`, which is a scrolling, selectable collection control that would give the strip more visual weight and interaction affordance than the source's deliberately unstyled, non-elevated intent. Map each item to a `Text` or custom view; styling is delegated to the consuming view's modifiers.
- **Compose**: Use a wrapping `Row`/`FlowRow` or plain `Column`—not `LazyColumn` with `verticalScroll`, which turns a short static strip into a scrolling list. Apply list semantics with `Modifier.semantics` (e.g. collection item info) rather than a scrolling container. Map each item to a composable within the layout; styling is the responsibility of item-level composables.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: Use a horizontal `NSStackView` (macOS) or `UIStackView` (iOS)—not `NSTableView`/`UITableView`, which are scrolling, selectable collection controls that would elevate the strip beyond its unstyled, non-feature intent. Provide list semantics via accessibility (list-like traits on the container, with each item announcing its position). No cell-level styling is applied by the component.
- **WinUI 3**: Use an `ItemsRepeater` without a `ScrollViewer`, or a `StackPanel`, bound to the items collection—not a scrolling `ListView`/`ScrollViewer`, which would add selection and scroll affordances the flat strip does not have. Define a `DataTemplate` per item and expose list semantics via `AutomationProperties`. Apply no item-level styling; styling is delegated to the template and the app's resource dictionary.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: The component is deliberately unstyled beyond `.lp-trust`/`.lp-trust li` (a wrapping flex row with small dot markers), and is not built from `Cards`.
**Rationale**: These are trust claims a visitor wants settled, not product features; boxing them like `Cards` would give them the same visual weight as the product's actual capabilities, which the source comment explicitly rejects.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Items are keyed by array index (`key={i}`) rather than a caller-supplied stable key.
**Rationale**: The component has no identity to key on for arbitrary `ReactNode` entries; index keys are adequate for the typical static list, but they mean an item's identity (and any item-local state) is not preserved if the `items` array is reordered between renders.
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [semantic-markup](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#semantic-markup) | passed | Accessibility |
| [screen-reader-support](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#screen-reader-support) | partial | Accessibility |

Both statuses rest on `Trust.tsx`: the component renders `<ul>`/`<li>` elements exclusively and nothing else (semantic-markup), but because item content is arbitrary consumer-supplied `ReactNode`s, the source cannot guarantee accessible labels on any interactive children it wraps (screen-reader-support).
