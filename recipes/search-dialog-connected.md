# Search Dialog Connected

## Overview

SearchDialogConnected is a connected wrapper component that provides a SearchDialog instance with data from the application's content, site configuration, and routing context. It derives the search state from a search index, maps section labels from site navigation, and handles selection by navigating to the chosen entry's URL slug and closing the dialog. Use this component to render a fully wired search dialog without manual state management.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **forwarded-props**: Component MUST accept and forward all SearchDialogProps except `state`, `onSelect`, and `sectionLabels` as specified by SearchDialogConnectedProps. `onClose` specifically is required (typed as `() => void`, not optional) because the selection handler below calls it directly.
- **search-state**: Component MUST compute search state by calling `useSearchState(searchIndex)` where searchIndex is obtained from `useContent()`.
- **section-labels**: Component MUST compute a mapping from section key to section label by iterating `nav.sections` from `useSiteConfig()`.
- **select-navigates**: Component MUST handle selection by calling `navigate(entry.slug)` (from `useCurrentRoute()`) and then calling the forwarded `onClose` callback.
- **renders-dialog**: Component MUST render the SearchDialog component with all computed values and forwarded props, passing computed state, mapped sectionLabels, and the selection handler.

## Appearance

Not applicable: SearchDialogConnected is a connected wrapper component that does not define visual appearance. All visual rendering is delegated to the SearchDialog component.

## States

SearchDialogConnected holds no state of its own — it defines no `useState`. The query text, result list, and selected index live in the `SearchState` returned by `useSearchState`; whether the dialog is open is owned by the caller via the forwarded `open` prop.

## Accessibility

Not applicable: SearchDialogConnected is a data-connection layer that does not define UI elements. All accessibility concerns are the responsibility of the SearchDialog component that it wraps.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| search-dialog-connected-001 | forwarded-props | SearchDialogConnectedProps with custom onClose handler | Component renders SearchDialog with all forwarded props intact |
| search-dialog-connected-002 | search-state | Content context provides searchIndex | useSearchState is called with searchIndex and result is passed to SearchDialog as state prop |
| search-dialog-connected-003 | section-labels | useSiteConfig returns nav with three sections: {key: 'guides', label: 'Guides'}, {key: 'api', label: 'API Reference'}, {key: 'examples', label: 'Examples'} | sectionLabels prop passed to SearchDialog contains {'guides': 'Guides', 'api': 'API Reference', 'examples': 'Examples'} |
| search-dialog-connected-004 | select-navigates | User selects entry with slug 'my-page' and component has onClose prop | navigate('my-page') is called, then onClose() is called in sequence |
| search-dialog-connected-005 | renders-dialog | Component invoked with any valid SearchDialogConnectedProps | SearchDialog is the component's sole rendered output, receiving computed state, sectionLabels, and the selection handler together with the forwarded props |
| search-dialog-connected-006 | section-labels | useSiteConfig returns nav with an empty sections array | sectionLabels passed to SearchDialog is {} and SearchDialog renders without error |

## Edge Cases

- **Empty sections array**: When nav.sections is empty, sectionLabels MUST be an empty object; SearchDialog receives valid (empty) sectionLabels and renders without error.
- **Zero-entry searchIndex**: `useContent()` types `searchIndex` as a required, non-optional `SearchIndex`, always constructed by `ContentProvider` via `createSearchIndex(entries)` — this component never receives a null or undefined index, so it performs no defensive check of its own. An index built from zero entries still renders normally: `index.query()` returns an empty results array and SearchDialog shows no results rather than crashing.
- **Missing entry.slug on selection**: `SiteEntry.slug` is typed as a required `string`, and SearchDialog only ever calls `onSelect` with an entry drawn from `state.results`, whose entries come from that same typed `SiteEntry[]`. `entry.slug` is therefore guaranteed by the type system; this case cannot occur.

## Configuration

Not applicable: SearchDialogConnected accepts only pass-through props forwarded to SearchDialog; it does not define its own configuration options.

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: SearchDialogConnected does not handle deep linking directly. Navigation is delegated to the navigate() function from useCurrentRoute(), which is responsible for deep link handling.

## Localization

Not applicable: SearchDialogConnected does not define localized strings. Section labels are sourced from site configuration (nav.sections), and all other text is delegated to SearchDialog.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: SearchDialogConnected is a wrapper component with no direct UI elements. All accessibility option handling is delegated to the SearchDialog component.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: The source code contains no feature flag logic or conditional rendering.

## Analytics

Not applicable: The source code contains no analytics event tracking or telemetry.

## Privacy

Not applicable: SearchDialogConnected is a data-connection component that does not collect, store, or transmit data. Data handling is the responsibility of useSearchState and useContent().

## Logging

Not applicable: The source code contains no logging or debug output.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web**: SearchDialogConnected is defined in `packages/web/packages/controls/src/search-dialog/SearchDialogConnected.tsx`. It is a client component ('use client'). It uses four hooks from @agenticdevelopertoolkit/model: useContent (for searchIndex), useSiteConfig (for nav.sections), useCurrentRoute (for navigate), and useSearchState (for search state derivation). The sectionLabels are computed once via useMemo to avoid recalculation on every render.
- **SwiftUI**: A thin container view that reads the search index, site navigation, and router via `@Environment` injection (not local `@State`, which would make the container own that data), derives search state and section labels, and passes them to a presentational `SearchDialog` view — mirroring the web split of `SearchDialogConnected` around `SearchDialog`. It performs no search algorithm or list construction of its own; selection calls the environment's navigation function, then dismisses the presented dialog.
- **Compose**: A stateful composable that reads `searchIndex` from a ViewModel or repository and `nav.sections` from a `SiteConfigRepository` via dependency injection, derives search state and the section-label map with `remember` / `derivedStateOf`, and composes a presentational `SearchDialog` composable with those values plus a select callback. It binds no list or search field itself; selection calls `NavController.navigate(entry.slug)`, then dismisses via the same state that shows the dialog.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: A thin controller — an `NSWindowController` on macOS, a `UIViewController` on iOS — that reads the search index, navigation, and router from injected services, derives search state and section labels, and hands them to a presentational search surface: an `NSSearchField`-backed panel on macOS, or a `.searchable`/`UISearchController`-backed view on iOS. It performs no list binding or search-controller delegate work of its own; selection navigates via the injected router, then dismisses the presentational dialog.
- **WinUI 3**: A thin control that reads the search index, navigation, and router from injected services (DI or a ViewModel), derives search state and the section-label map, and passes them to a presentational search surface built from `ContentDialog` hosting an `AutoSuggestBox` — supplying the derived items, labels, and a selection callback rather than binding its own `ItemsControl`/`ListView` or handling `SelectionChanged` itself. Selection navigates via the injected `INavigationService`, then calls the dialog's `Hide()`.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: SearchDialogConnected is a thin connected wrapper; all presentation — layout, list rendering, input handling — is delegated to a presentational SearchDialog component.
**Rationale**: Keeps SearchDialog reusable with different data sources (testing, alternative content), while SearchDialogConnected orchestrates the integration with the application's standard data layer.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: `sectionLabels` is computed with `useMemo` keyed on `nav.sections`, but the selection handler passed as `onSelect` is defined inline and is not wrapped in `useCallback`.
**Rationale**: `useMemo` avoids recomputing the label map when unrelated props cause the wrapper to re-render. The selection handler needs no referential stability because SearchDialog never uses it as an effect or memoization dependency — it is only invoked directly from a keyboard or click handler.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Selection handling calls `navigate(entry.slug)` before calling `onClose()`.
**Rationale**: Ensures navigation state updates before the dialog disappears, avoiding a moment where the dialog closes but the route has not yet changed.
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [keyboard-navigable](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#keyboard-navigable) | partial | Accessibility |

Keyboard handling, focus management, and ARIA structure live entirely in SearchDialog and useSearchState; this wrapper forwards `open`, `onClose`, and the rest of SearchDialogProps unmodified (see **forwarded-props**), so the source shows it does not break that behavior but, as a pass-through layer, cannot itself demonstrate full conformance.
