# SearchFilterBar

## Overview

A search-and-filter bar in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui` that sits above a list. It combines a
single icon-led search `Input` with a configurable row of filter `Select`s. Every
axis is **fully controlled** by the caller (value + `onChange`), and the option
sets for each select are supplied by the caller — so narrowing the list (which
typically refetches the rows) never empties a dropdown of its own options.

It is the single home for the "search + filters above a list" pattern. First
consumer: the hub `/research` document list (`ResearchFilters` is a thin domain
adapter that maps its `{ q, category, tag }` state onto this component).

## Behavioral Requirements

- **must-wrap-in-search-region**: The SearchFilterBar MUST render its controls
  inside a single element with `role="search"`.
- **must-control-search-field**: The SearchFilterBar MUST render the search field
  as a controlled `type="search"` input bound to `search.value`, calling
  `search.onChange` with the new string on every keystroke.
- **must-label-search-field**: The SearchFilterBar MUST expose `search.label` as
  the search field's accessible name (the field is icon-only, with no visible
  label).
- **must-render-one-select-per-filter**: The SearchFilterBar MUST render exactly
  one `Select` per entry in `filters`, each labelled by its `label`, in the given
  order, with a leading all-pass option whose value is the empty string and whose
  text is `allLabel`.
- **must-list-caller-options**: The SearchFilterBar MUST render each filter's
  `options` (in order) as `<option>`s after the all-pass entry. A bare string
  option MUST be used as both the value and the visible text; a
  `{ value, label }` option MUST store `value` and read as `label`. The two forms
  MUST be mixable on one axis.
- **must-reflect-and-report-filter-value**: The SearchFilterBar MUST set each
  select's current value from the filter's `value` and call that filter's
  `onChange` with the newly selected value (the empty string when the all-pass
  entry is chosen).
- **must-render-extra-controls-in-filter-row**: The SearchFilterBar MUST render
  `children` in the filter row, after any `filters`, so a caller-supplied control
  is one more axis on the same row rather than a second bar.
- **must-omit-empty-filter-row**: The SearchFilterBar MUST NOT render the filter
  row when it would be empty — no `filters` and no `children` that React would
  actually render (a `false`/`null` child does not open the row).
- **must-lay-out-by-orientation**: The SearchFilterBar MUST stack the filter row
  under the search field by default (`orientation="stacked"`), and MUST lay the
  field and the row out as one wrapping line when `orientation="inline"`, the
  search field taking the free space with a minimum width of its own.
- **may-scope-autofill-with-a-form**: The SearchFilterBar MAY root itself on a
  `<form>` instead of a `<div>` when `asForm` is set, carrying `role="search"`
  onto that element and cancelling its `submit`. It MUST default to the `<div>`.

## Appearance

```
role="search"
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ (search)  Search documents…                    │   <- Input (type=search), icon inset
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────────┐
│ All categories    v │ │ All tags          v │   <- one Select per filter, in a row
└─────────────────────┘ └─────────────────────┘
```

- Root: `flex flex-col gap-2` when stacked, `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2`
  when inline (+ any `className`), `role="search"` — on a `<div>`, or on a
  `<form>` when `asForm` is set.
- Search: the shared `Input` (`type="search"`, `className="pl-8"`) with a
  `lucide-react` `Search` icon absolutely positioned at the left
  (`absolute top-1/2 left-2.5 size-3.5 -translate-y-1/2 text-apt-text-muted`,
  `aria-hidden`, `pointer-events-none`).
- Filter row: `flex gap-2`, each child the shared `Select` (full-width, so two
  selects share the row evenly and stack gracefully on narrow viewports),
  followed by any `children`.
- Inline only: the search field's wrapper takes `min-w-48 flex-1` — a bare
  `flex-1` would let an empty field collapse to its icon, since a flex item's
  floor is its content width and an empty search box has none.
- Colors are inherited from the `Input`/`Select` primitives — `apt-*` tokens only,
  no raw hex, no `!important`.

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|---|---|
| Default | Search empty (placeholder shown); each select on its all-pass option |
| Search focused | `Input` gold focus ring (`focus-visible:ring-apt-gold/25`) |
| Filter active | Select shows the chosen option value |
| Filter focused | `Select` gold focus ring |
| No filters configured | Only the search field renders; no filter row |
| Disabled (per-primitive) | Inherited `Input`/`Select` disabled styling if the caller disables the underlying controls |

## Accessibility

- The container is a `role="search"` landmark region, optionally named by
  `aria-label` — recommended when a page carries more than one search region.
  `asForm` moves that role onto a `<form>`, which changes nothing for assistive
  tech: a `<form>` is a landmark only once it is named, and this one's name and
  role are the region's.
- The search field is labelled by `search.label` via `aria-label` (icon-only, no
  visible `<label>`), and is a `type="search"` box (`role="searchbox"`).
- Each filter `Select` is labelled by its `label` via `aria-label`.
- The decorative search icon is `aria-hidden` and not focusable.
- All controls are native, so keyboard operability and focus order are inherited
  from the platform.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | must-wrap-in-search-region | Render with only `search` | A single `role="search"` element wraps the controls |
| T2 | must-control-search-field, must-label-search-field | `search.label="Search documents"`; type `agents` | `getByRole("searchbox", { name: "Search documents" })` resolves; `onChange("agents")` fires |
| T3 | must-omit-empty-filter-row | Render with no `filters` | No `combobox`/select is present |
| T4 | must-render-one-select-per-filter, must-list-caller-options | Two filters (`category` opts `[Agents, Retrieval]`, `tag` opts `[rag]`) | Two labelled selects; `category` lists `All categories`, `Agents`, `Retrieval` (in order); `tag` lists `All tags`, `rag` |
| T5 | must-reflect-and-report-filter-value | `category.value="Agents"`; select `Retrieval` | Select shows `Agents` initially; `category.onChange("Retrieval")` fires |
| T6 | must-reflect-and-report-filter-value | `category.value="Agents"`; choose `All categories` | `category.onChange("")` fires |
| T7 | must-list-caller-options | One axis, `options: [{ value: "st-1", label: "Todo" }, { value: "st-2", label: "Done" }]`; select `Done` | Options read `Todo`/`Done` and none reads `st-1`; `onChange("st-2")` fires |
| T8 | must-list-caller-options | One axis, `options: ["Backlog", { value: "it-1", label: "Sprint 3" }]` | Option `Backlog` has value `Backlog`; option `Sprint 3` has value `it-1` |
| T9 | must-render-extra-controls-in-filter-row, must-omit-empty-filter-row | One filter plus a `<button>Platforms</button>` child; then the same child with no filters; then `{false}` as the only child | Button and select share one row; the child alone still draws the row; `{false}` draws no row (one child element under the root) |
| T10 | must-lay-out-by-orientation | Render default, then rerender `orientation="inline"` | Root has `flex-col` by default; inline drops it for `flex-wrap`, and the field wrapper carries `flex-1 min-w-48` |
| T11 | may-scope-autofill-with-a-form | Render default, then rerender `asForm` | Root is a `DIV`, then a `FORM`; exactly one `role="search"` either way; `fireEvent.submit` on the form reports the event cancelled |

## Edge Cases

- **Empty option list**: a filter with `options: []` still renders its all-pass
  option, so the select is never empty.
- **Stale selected value**: if a filter's `value` is not present in `options`, the
  native select falls back to no matching option; the caller owns keeping `value`
  within the option universe (e.g. the research pane sources options from the
  *unfiltered* document universe for this reason).
- **Search-only bar**: omit `filters` (or pass `[]`) for a bare search field.
- **Duplicate option strings**: `options` are keyed by their own string, so the
  caller must pre-dedupe; duplicates would collide on the React key.

## Configuration

`@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/components/search-filter-bar`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search` | `SearchFieldConfig` | — (required) | The search field config (see below) |
| `filters` | `FilterSelectConfig[]` | `[]` | Filter selects rendered in the filter row |
| `orientation` | `"stacked" \| "inline"` | `"stacked"` | Filter row under the field, or one wrapping line with it |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | — | Extra filter controls, rendered in the row after `filters` |
| `asForm` | `boolean` | `false` | Root on a `<form>` (submit cancelled) rather than a `<div>`, to scope autofill |
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes on the `role="search"` root |
| `aria-label` | `string` | — | Accessible name for the `role="search"` landmark |

```ts
interface SearchFieldConfig {
  value: string                       // controlled text
  onChange: (value: string) => void   // called per keystroke
  label: string                       // accessible name (icon-only field)
  placeholder?: string
  onKeyDown?: (e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void
}

interface FilterSelectOption {
  value: string                       // what the axis stores and reports
  label: string                       // what the option reads as
}

interface FilterSelectConfig {
  name: string                        // stable React key / axis id
  label: string                       // accessible name for the select
  value: string                       // selected value ("" = all-pass)
  options: readonly (string | FilterSelectOption)[]  // bare string = value is the text
  allLabel: string                    // text of the leading all-pass option
  onChange: (value: string) => void   // called with the new value ("" = all-pass)
}

interface SearchFilterBarProps {
  search: SearchFieldConfig
  filters?: FilterSelectConfig[]
  orientation?: "stacked" | "inline"
  children?: React.ReactNode
  asForm?: boolean
  className?: string
  "aria-label"?: string
}
export function SearchFilterBar(props: SearchFilterBarProps): React.ReactElement
```

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: this is a presentational component with no associated document or state to link to. Deep linking is the responsibility of the consuming feature.

## Localization

Not applicable: the component itself defines no user-facing strings. The search placeholder, filter labels, and all-pass option text are supplied by the caller as part of the component configuration and are localized at the point of use.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: accessibility preferences (Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, Differentiate Without Color) are handled by the composed `Input` and `Select` primitives and inherited by SearchFilterBar.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: this is a reusable UI primitive with no feature-flag concerns. Feature gating occurs at the level of the consuming feature, not the component.

## Analytics

Not applicable: this is a presentational component that emits no telemetry. Searches and filter changes are observed and logged by the consuming feature (e.g., the research pane's list fetch and event tracking), not by the bar itself.

## Privacy

Not applicable: the component stores no data, collects no telemetry, and transmits nothing. All user input is relayed to the caller via `onChange` callbacks; what the caller does with that input is the caller's responsibility.

## Logging

This ingredient is presentational and emits no structured log events. Searches and
filter changes are observed by the consuming feature (e.g. the research pane's list
fetch + telemetry), not by the bar.

## Platform Notes

- **React / Web (TypeScript):** Component at
  `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/search-filter-bar.tsx`, composing the shared
  `Input` and `Select` primitives. Demoed in `ui-showcase` (Forms group). The hub
  `ResearchFilters` adapts its `{ q, category, tag }` `FilterState` onto it.
- **iOS / Safari:** a search field with no `<form>` ancestor is scoped for
  autofill against the whole document, so on a page that also carries
  contact-shaped content iOS can offer "AutoFill Contact" over the search box.
  `asForm` is the fix for those pages; the attribute bag the shared `Input`
  applies (`autocomplete="off"` plus the password-manager opt-outs) is not
  sufficient on its own.
- **SwiftUI:** Build from `SearchField` for the search input and a `Picker` per filter wrapped in a `VStack`. The search field is `SearchField` with modifier `.searchScopes([.default])` or custom suggestions handler bound to `search.value` and `search.onChange`. Each filter renders as a `Picker` with its options in a horizontal row (use `HStack` with `orientation="inline"`, or `VStack` for `orientation="stacked"`). The all-pass option is rendered as the `.tag("")` entry. The `asForm` property maps to wrapping the stack in a `Form` that no-ops its submission.
- **Compose:** Build from `OutlinedTextField` for the search input and `ExposedDropdownMenuBox` per filter in a horizontal row (use `Row` with `horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp)` for `orientation="inline"`, or `Column` for `orientation="stacked"`). The search field is fully controlled by `value`/`onValueChange` with a leading search icon (`Icons.Default.Search`) rendered via a `leadingIcon` lambda. Each dropdown's all-pass option is the default selection (value `""`). The `asForm` property wraps the layout in a `Column` — no form submission exists in Compose; treat it as a composition point for caller validation logic.
- **AppKit / UIKit:** Build from `NSSearchField` (macOS) or `UISearchBar` (iOS) for the search, and `NSPopUpButton` (macOS) or `UIPickerView` (iOS) for each filter in an `NSStackView`/`UIStackView` horizontal arrangement. On iOS, `UISegmentedControl` is an alternative for filters with few options. The search field is bound to `search.value` via target-action (`editingChanged:` event). Each picker/segmented control is bound to its `onChange` handler. The row layout respects the `orientation` parameter; stack it vertically by default (`NSStackView.Orientation.vertical` / `UIStackView.Axis.vertical`) or horizontally for inline. The `asForm` property wraps the entire stack in a `UIView` with a title label for naming the search region (equivalent to `role="search"`).
- **WinUI 3:** Build from `AutoSuggestBox` or `TextBox` with `ComboBox` per filter in a horizontal `StackPanel` or `Grid`. The search field is a `TextBox` with `PlaceholderText` bound to `search.placeholder`, two-way binding to `search.value`, and `TextChanged` event handler calling `search.onChange` — debounce using `DispatcherTimer` if needed (the component provides no built-in debounce; see Design Decisions for the 300ms threshold). Each filter is a `ComboBox` with items bound to the options list, the all-pass entry prepended manually, two-way binding to `value`, and `SelectionChanged` event calling `onChange`. Render filters in a `StackPanel` with `Orientation="Horizontal"` for inline layout, or `Vertical` for stacked. The `asForm` property wraps the root in a `Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ContentControl` with a `Name` property set to reflect the search region (no native form equivalent; treat as a composition container for validation and submission).

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: Both the search field and every filter select are fully
  controlled, with caller-supplied option sets. **Rationale**: explicit-over-
  implicit — the bar owns no list/data state; it cannot desync from the consumer,
  and the consumer keeps option universes stable so narrowing never empties a
  dropdown.
- **Decision**: An option is a bare string *or* a `{ value, label }` pair, and the
  two mix on one axis. **Rationale**: the original `string[]` was a yagni bet that
  a consumer proved wrong — an axis over *records* (a status, an iteration, an
  owner) filters by id and reads as a name. Making the caller keep a label↔id
  codec of its own would be a lossy guess about data it already holds correctly:
  two ids can share a display name, and two names can share an id. The bare string
  stays as the shorthand for the case where they coincide, so no existing caller
  had to change.
- **Decision**: `children` land in the filter row rather than in a config union.
  **Rationale**: yagni / optimize-for-change — `filters` covers the single-select
  axis, which is most of them; an axis that is genuinely a different control (a
  multi-select, a date range, a toggle group) composes at the call site instead of
  growing a union that has to describe every control the platform will ever filter
  with. The bar supplies the landmark, the field and the row.
- **Decision**: `asForm` lives here, off by default, rather than each host
  wrapping the bar in its own `<form>`. **Rationale**: dry — "a search field with
  no form ancestor is autofilled against the whole document" is a property of
  search fields, not of any one page, and it is a measured platform quirk that
  needs a paragraph to be legible at a call site. Default-off because a bar
  rendered inside a host's own form would nest one, which the parser resolves by
  dropping it.
- **Decision**: Compose the existing `Input` + `Select` primitives rather than
  restyle. **Rationale**: dry / consistency — the bar inherits the standard
  focus-ring and token treatment, so it matches every other field on the platform.
- **Decision**: The filter row is omitted entirely when `filters` is empty.
  **Rationale**: principle-of-least-astonishment — a search-only bar shows no empty
  control row.
