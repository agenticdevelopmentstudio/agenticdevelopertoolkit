# Hierarchical Document View

## Overview

**HDV** (Hierarchical Document View) is the family's long-form **document reader**:
a three-column layout of a collapsible multi-depth nav tree, a prose centre column
(breadcrumbs → article → frontmatter → change history → view-source), and a
scrollspy table of contents. It is extracted from the cookbook site, which had the
best reader in the family trapped inside one Next app.

HDV is **not** a variant of `HierarchicalTopicDetail`. HTDV's `TopicDetailItem` is
flat — it has no `children` — so it structurally cannot render a nested document
tree; and HTDV stacks *panes* horizontally where HDV nests *one* tree vertically at
arbitrary depth with per-branch collapse. They are different shapes that happen to
share the word "hierarchical".

**The reader landed in stages**, completed in 1.4.0, then hardened in 1.5.x:

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| `DocBreadcrumbs`, `DocArticle`, `DocMetadata` | 1.0.0 |
| `DocTableOfContents` + `useScrollSpy` | 1.1.0 |
| `ViewSourceDisclosure` | 1.2.0 |
| `DocNavTree` / `DocNav` | 1.3.0 |
| `HierarchicalDocumentView` + `DocPage` (the frame) | 1.4.0 |
| Hardening: shared drawer collapse state, one announced dismiss control, ordered scrollspy, no dangling `aria-controls` | 1.5.0 |
| Platform Notes restructured per platform | 1.5.1 |

The governing constraint for the whole extraction is that **it is a move, not a
redesign**: every default here byte-matches what the cookbook site rendered before
it, so a visual delta is a bug rather than a judgement call. Redesign happens later,
on a green base.

There are exactly **two** recorded exceptions to that byte-match, recorded
precisely so they are not drift — and only one of the two is visible.

**The chevrons.** Every one is lucide's `ChevronRight` rather than the site's
hand-rolled inline `<svg>` — `ViewSourceDisclosure`'s and the nav section's
collapse control. Same box, same stroke width, same rotation — the glyph itself is
one pixel narrower at `h-3 w-3`. Copying a bespoke icon path into a toolkit that
already depends on lucide would duplicate knowledge lucide owns (`dry`); the pixel
is the price, and it is named here rather than discovered later.

**The content region is a `div`, not a `main`.** The site wrapped the document
region in `<main className="flex-1 min-w-0">` — *inside* the `main` its shared
`AppShell` already renders. Two nested `main` landmarks is invalid HTML, and
extracting the frame forced the choice: rendering a `main` here would bake the bug
into every future consumer. So the frame renders a `div` and the host keeps its one
landmark. Zero visual delta (both are `display: block`), one element name changed,
and one pre-existing a11y defect gone.

The nav column's parity was **measured, not asserted**, against the pre-extraction
production build — see Change History 1.3.0 for the pages sampled and the byte
delta, which resolves to exactly the four intended changes named there: the lucide
chevron above, a dropped `data-autoscroll` attribute nothing read, and the
`type="button"` and `aria-expanded` the original toggle lacked.

Three seams keep site vocabulary out of the toolkit:

- **Routing.** HDV never imports `next/link` or `next/navigation`. A host injects
  its router as `LinkComponent` (a component taking `to`, not `href`) and tells HDV
  which page is current with a plain `activePath` string. The default is a bare
  `<a href>`, so a non-Next app needs no adapter at all.
- **Vocabulary.** HDV lays a frontmatter block out; it never decides what a
  document's frontmatter *contains*. The host maps its own fields to a list of
  label/value pairs.
- **Chrome.** HDV lists every heading it is given. Which headings are *chrome*
  rather than argument — a change history, a licence footer — is the host's call,
  made by naming ids in `excludeIds`. Omit it and nothing is filtered.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-crumbs-in-order**: `DocBreadcrumbs` MUST render a fixed home crumb first, then one crumb per entry of `crumbs` in the given order, separated by a `/` glyph before every crumb but never before home.
- **render-current-page-as-text**: `DocBreadcrumbs` MUST render the LAST crumb as non-interactive text and every earlier crumb, plus home, as a link.
- **hide-empty-trail**: `DocBreadcrumbs` MUST render nothing at all when `crumbs` is empty, rather than a lone home crumb pointing at the current page.
- **route-through-injected-link**: `DocBreadcrumbs` and `DocNavTree` MUST render every navigational link through `LinkComponent`, passing the destination as `to`, and MUST default to a plain `<a href>` when the host injects none.
- **accept-a-relabelled-home**: `DocBreadcrumbs` MUST honour `homeLabel` and `homeHref` so a host can re-point or rename the first crumb.
- **render-trusted-html**: `DocArticle` MUST render the `html` string as markup inside its element, and MUST apply the family prose typography contract to it.
- **expose-the-prose-contract**: The prose class list MUST be exported so a host can apply the same typography to prose it renders itself.
- **honor-article-element**: `DocArticle` MUST render as an `article` by default and as the element named by `as` otherwise.
- **render-one-row-per-field**: `DocMetadata` MUST render one `dt`/`dd` row per entry of `fields`, in the given order, right-aligned as a single column.
- **group-list-values**: `DocMetadata` MUST render an array `value` as a wrapping right-aligned group of its items, and any other `value` as-is with no wrapper.
- **hide-empty-metadata**: `DocMetadata` MUST render nothing when `fields` is empty.
- **list-every-heading-by-default**: `DocTableOfContents` MUST list every entry of `headings`, in document order, when `excludeIds` is omitted — it MUST hold no opinion of its own about which headings belong.
- **omit-excluded-headings**: `DocTableOfContents` MUST omit exactly the headings whose `id` appears in `excludeIds`, from both the rendered list and the set of observed elements.
- **hide-empty-outline**: `DocTableOfContents` MUST render nothing when no heading survives filtering.
- **indent-by-depth**: `DocTableOfContents` MUST indent a depth-3 heading further than a shallower one, and MUST render the list flat rather than nesting sub-lists.
- **mark-the-current-heading**: `DocTableOfContents` MUST mark exactly one heading — the FIRST, in the order the ids were given, of those currently inside the band — and MUST move that marker rather than accumulating marks.
- **scroll-not-navigate**: `DocTableOfContents` MUST prevent the anchor's default navigation and scroll to the heading smoothly, leaving the URL unchanged.
- **track-by-id-value**: `useScrollSpy` MUST re-subscribe when the ids' VALUES change and MUST NOT re-subscribe when only the array's identity changes, so a caller may derive its ids inline on every render.
- **observe-only-existing-elements**: `useScrollSpy` MUST skip ids with no matching element, and MUST disconnect its observer on unmount.
- **carry-visibility-across-callbacks**: `useScrollSpy` MUST remember which ids are inside the band across callbacks, and MUST resolve the marked id from the ORDER OF `ids` rather than from the order the observer reported. An `IntersectionObserver` callback carries only what CHANGED, in no guaranteed order, so a consumer that re-reads each batch in isolation loses every heading it was not told about again.
- **hold-the-last-position**: `useScrollSpy` MUST keep its marked id when the band empties — a reader between two headings is still somewhere.
- **start-collapsed**: `ViewSourceDisclosure` MUST render no source panel until asked, and MUST omit it from the DOM entirely rather than hiding it, so the document's text is never duplicated for search or assistive tech.
- **toggle-both-ways**: `ViewSourceDisclosure` MUST reveal the source on activation and hide it again on the next, and MUST honour `defaultOpen` for the initial state.
- **render-source-verbatim**: `ViewSourceDisclosure` MUST render `source` as text, never as markup — a document whose source contains HTML shows that HTML.
- **announce-its-state**: `ViewSourceDisclosure`'s trigger MUST carry `aria-expanded` reflecting the current state, and `aria-controls` naming the panel it reveals — present only while that panel is in the DOM, because `aria-controls` is an IDREF and one pointing at nothing is an authoring error (axe: `aria-valid-attr-value`), not a harmless no-op.
- **collapse-only-the-top-level**: `DocNavTree` MUST render a collapse control for top-level sections only; every directory below that MUST render its children unconditionally.
- **open-the-active-section**: `DocNavTree` MUST open, on mount, exactly those sections that contain or are the active page, and leave every other section closed.
- **keep-the-readers-collapse-state**: `DocNavTree` MUST NOT re-derive a section's open state when `activePath` changes — once mounted, that state belongs to the reader.
- **mark-the-active-page**: `DocNavTree` MUST mark exactly the node whose `href` equals `activePath` with `aria-current="page"`, and MUST move that mark rather than accumulating marks when `activePath` changes.
- **list-pages-before-directories**: `DocNavTree` MUST render a node's childless children before its directory children, at every level, whatever order the host passed them in.
- **inline-supplied-headings**: `DocNavTree` MUST render a leaf's `headings` beneath its link when the host supplies them, MUST filter none of them, and MUST render no sub-list when it supplies none.
- **scroll-when-already-on-the-page**: A heading link MUST scroll smoothly and write the hash without navigating when its own page is the active one, and MUST behave as an ordinary link from anywhere else.
- **drop-the-divider-with-the-rows**: `DocNav` MUST render the rule above the tree only when `topLinks` is non-empty.
- **control-the-drawer**: `DocNav`'s mobile drawer MUST be controlled by `open`, and MUST call `onClose` from both dismiss targets — the scrim and the close button — because the control that opens it lives outside HDV.
- **announce-one-dismiss-control**: The drawer MUST expose exactly ONE control named `closeLabel` to assistive tech. The scrim dismisses on click but MUST be `aria-hidden` and out of the tab order: two identically-named controls read as two different actions, and a named `button` spanning the viewport is announced over the whole document.
- **share-one-nav**: `DocNav` MUST render the identical nav — the same fixed rows, rule, and tree — in the desktop column and in the drawer, and both MUST read ONE collapse state: a section the reader opens in the drawer is open in the column too, and stays open when the drawer closes.
- **place-the-nav-before-the-document**: `HierarchicalDocumentView` MUST render `nav` first and the document region after it, and `DocPage` MUST render the document before the rail.
- **slot-columns-unwrapped**: Both frames MUST render a slotted column as a direct child of their flex row, adding no wrapper of their own, so each column's own `sticky` offset resolves against the frame.
- **drop-an-omitted-column**: Omitting `nav` or `toc` MUST leave no element behind — a reader with no tree gets no empty column, not a zero-width one.
- **cap-the-measure**: `DocPage` MUST cap the document at the reader's measure and MUST allow that column to shrink below its content, so a wide code block cannot push the rail off the page.
- **render-no-landmark**: Each frame MUST NOT render a `main` or any other landmark element. The host's app shell owns its landmarks; HDV owns the columns.
- **spread-host-attributes**: `DocBreadcrumbs`, `DocArticle`, `DocMetadata`, `DocTableOfContents`, `ViewSourceDisclosure`, `DocNavTree`, `DocNav`, `HierarchicalDocumentView`, and `DocPage` MUST all spread remaining host attributes (`data-*`, `id`, handlers) onto their root element.

## Appearance

The centre column is a `max-w-3xl` prose measure. Every colour is a flat
`--color-*` token from the shared ADH theme — the same contract
a host theme package provides to every site in the family — so HDV inherits
the host's palette without a per-site restyle.

- The frame is two nested flex rows and nothing else. The outer one (`HIERARCHICAL_DOCUMENT_VIEW_CLASS`) is `flex flex-1`, its content region (`HIERARCHICAL_DOCUMENT_VIEW_CONTENT_CLASS`) `flex-1 min-w-0`; the inner one (`DOC_PAGE_CLASS`) is `flex`, its document column (`DOC_PAGE_ARTICLE_CLASS`) `flex-1 min-w-0 px-6 py-8 lg:px-10 max-w-3xl`. The `max-w-3xl` is the whole reason the frame is shared: prose set to the full width of a 1440px window is unreadable, and `min-w-0` is what stops a wide table from shoving the rail off the edge.
- Nav column: `aside.hidden.lg:block w-80 shrink-0 border-r
  border-[var(--color-border-subtle)] overflow-y-auto sticky
  top-[var(--adh-header-height,3.5rem)]
  h-[calc(100vh-var(--adh-header-height,3.5rem))]` — sticky under the family's header
  and scrolling on its own, so a 466-page tree never pushes the document down. The
  offset **reads** `--adh-header-height` rather than restating it: that header is a
  bar plus a full-width preview strip above it, so any literal is a copy that goes
  stale the next time it grows. The `3.5rem` fallback is the bar alone, for the
  consumers of this package that mount no adh header at all. The `nav` inside is
  `flex flex-col gap-6 px-6 py-6 overflow-y-auto h-full`, and the same element is
  rendered into the drawer.
- Fixed rows: `h3.relative font-mono text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest
  text-[var(--color-accent)] transition-colors`, its link hovering to
  `text-[var(--color-accent)]`; the active row carries an absolutely-positioned
  `-left-6 w-0.5 bg-[var(--color-accent)]` bar that sits out in the column's
  padding, clear of the text. Their divider is a lone
  `div.border-t border-[var(--color-border-subtle)]`.
- Section: a `flex items-center gap-1` row of a `p-0.5` chevron button — `h-3 w-3
  shrink-0 transition-transform duration-150` at `strokeWidth={2.5}`, gaining
  `rotate-90` while open — and a label sharing the fixed rows' type exactly. Its
  child list is `flex flex-col border-l border-[var(--color-border)] mt-1`; every
  list below that is the same rule indented past its parent's text, `ml-3.5`, so the
  rails stack one indent apart down the column.
- Entries: a leaf is `relative block py-0.5 text-sm transition-colors`, a mid-tree
  directory `py-1` — one notch more air where the tree branches. Selected is
  `font-semibold text-[var(--color-text-primary)]` plus a `w-px
  bg-[var(--color-accent)]` bar down its own left edge; an ancestor of the active
  page is `font-medium text-[var(--color-text-primary)]`; everything else is
  `text-[var(--color-text-secondary)]` hovering to primary. Links and inlined
  headings share one `padding-inline-start: 0.875rem`, so their text lines up
  whatever depth they sit at.
- Inlined headings: `relative block py-0.5 text-xs text-[var(--color-text-dim)]`
  hovering to secondary — a notch smaller and dimmer than the page links they hang
  under, so an outline never competes with the tree.
- Drawer: `div.fixed.inset-0.z-50.lg:hidden` holding a full-bleed `bg-black/50`
  scrim (`div[aria-hidden]`, click-to-dismiss) and `aside.fixed.inset-y-0.left-0 w-72
  bg-[var(--color-surface)] shadow-xl overflow-y-auto`, headed by
  `flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-4 border-b
  border-[var(--color-border-subtle)]` with a `font-mono text-sm font-medium` title
  and a lucide `X` at `h-5 w-5`. The panel is `w-72` where the desktop column is
  `w-80` — a drawer leaves the page behind it visible.
- Breadcrumbs: `nav[aria-label="Breadcrumb"] mb-4` → `ol.flex.items-center.gap-1
  font-mono text-xs text-[var(--color-text-dim)]`; separator
  `text-[var(--color-border)]`; current page `text-[var(--color-text-secondary)]`;
  links hover to `text-[var(--color-text-secondary)]`.
- Article: `prose max-w-none prose-headings:scroll-mt-20
  prose-code:before:content-none prose-code:after:content-none`. The
  `scroll-mt-20` is load-bearing — it keeps a heading clear of the sticky header
  when the ToC scrolls to it.
- Metadata: `dl.flex.flex-col.items-end.gap-0.5 font-mono text-[11px] mb-6`; rows
  `flex gap-2`; `dt` dim, `dd` secondary; a list value wraps in
  `flex flex-wrap justify-end gap-x-3`.
- Table of contents: `aside.hidden.xl:block w-56 shrink-0 sticky
  top-[var(--adh-header-height,3.5rem)]
  h-[calc(100vh-var(--adh-header-height,3.5rem))] overflow-y-auto py-8 pr-4`; header
  `font-mono text-[10px] font-medium uppercase tracking-widest
  text-[var(--color-text-dim)] mb-3`; list
  `flex flex-col gap-1 border-l border-[var(--color-border-subtle)]` with each
  `li` pulled back `-ml-px` so its own left border sits *on* the rail. Entries are
  `block border-l py-0.5 text-sm transition-colors` + `pl-3` (depth ≤ 2) or `pl-6`
  (depth 3); marked entries add
  `border-[var(--color-accent)] text-[var(--color-text-primary)] font-medium`,
  unmarked ones `border-transparent text-[var(--color-text-dim)]`.
- The rail is desktop-only (`hidden xl:block`): below `xl` there is no room beside
  a `max-w-3xl` measure, and the document's own headings are the outline.
- View source: the row is `mt-8 border-t border-[var(--color-border-subtle)] pt-4`
  — a hairline rule *above* the trigger, separating it from the document rather
  than framing it. The trigger is `flex items-center gap-1.5 font-mono text-xs
  text-[var(--color-text-dim)]` hovering to `text-[var(--color-text-secondary)]`,
  with an `h-3 w-3 transition-transform duration-150` chevron that gains
  `rotate-90` while open. The panel is `mt-3 p-4 rounded-md
  bg-[var(--color-surface-raised)] border border-[var(--color-border-subtle)]
  overflow-x-auto font-mono text-xs text-[var(--color-text-secondary)]
  leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-wrap` — it wraps rather than truncating, and
  scrolls only when a single unbreakable token is wider than the column.
- The row is deliberately the quietest thing on the page: dim mono micro-type at
  the very bottom. A reader who wants the markdown will look for it; one who does
  not should never notice it.
- No raw hex, no `!important`.

## States

| Component | State | Rendering |
|---|---|---|
| `DocNavTree` | section outside the active page | closed; chevron unrotated |
| `DocNavTree` | section containing, or equal to, the active page | open on mount |
| `DocNavTree` | section the reader toggled | stays as they left it across route changes |
| `DocNavTree` | directory at depth ≥ 1 | always expanded; no control rendered |
| `DocNavTree` | node whose `href` is `activePath` | `aria-current="page"`, bold, accent bar |
| `DocNavTree` | node that is an ancestor of the active page | `font-medium`, no bar, no `aria-current` |
| `DocNavTree` | leaf with no `headings` | link only; no sub-list in the DOM |
| `DocNav` | `topLinks` empty or omitted | no fixed rows **and** no divider |
| `DocNav` | `open: false` | the desktop aside only — no drawer, no backdrop |
| `DocNav` | `open: true` | aside + backdrop + drawer, the same nav in both shells |
| `HierarchicalDocumentView` | `nav` omitted | one child, the content region — no empty column |
| `HierarchicalDocumentView` | `nav` given | the column, then the content region, as siblings |
| `DocPage` | `toc` omitted | the document column alone, at full width of the region |
| `DocPage` | `toc` given | the document at its measure, the rail beside it |
| `DocBreadcrumbs` | trail non-empty | home + crumbs, last as text |
| `DocBreadcrumbs` | `crumbs: []` (site root) | renders nothing |
| `DocBreadcrumbs` | crumb link hover | text lifts dim → secondary |
| `DocArticle` | `html: ""` | an empty prose container (the host decides whether to render it) |
| `DocMetadata` | `fields: []` | renders nothing |
| `DocMetadata` | array value | items wrap right-aligned across lines |
| `DocTableOfContents` | no heading survives filtering | renders nothing |
| `DocTableOfContents` | before any heading is reached | every entry unmarked |
| `DocTableOfContents` | a heading enters the band | that entry marked, the previous one cleared |
| `DocTableOfContents` | viewport below `xl` | hidden |
| `ViewSourceDisclosure` | collapsed (default) | rule + trigger only; no panel in the DOM |
| `ViewSourceDisclosure` | expanded | chevron rotated 90°, `<pre>` panel below the trigger |
| `ViewSourceDisclosure` | `source: ""` | an empty panel — a document with no body still has a source |

`HierarchicalDocumentView`, `DocPage`, `DocBreadcrumbs`, `DocArticle`, and
`DocMetadata` are pure and stateless — no internal state, no effects, and therefore
no `"use client"` boundary; they render identically on the server and the client.
The two frames hold no props but their slots and a `className`, which is why they
can sit in a server layout with a client tree passed into them. `DocTableOfContents` is a client
component: it holds the marked id and subscribes an `IntersectionObserver`. It
server-renders its full list with nothing marked, so the outline is in the HTML
before hydration. `ViewSourceDisclosure` is a client component too, but holds only
open/closed state — it server-renders its rule and trigger, collapsed.

`DocNavTree` is a client component carrying one open/closed boolean per top-level
section, and it server-renders the tree with the active section **already open** —
so a reader's first paint is the correct tree, not a closed one that expands on
hydration. It holds that state itself when it stands alone, and takes it from above
(`expandedSections` + `onToggleSection`) when something has to share it.

`DocNav` is that something. Its desktop column and its drawer are two component
INSTANCES of one element description, so each would otherwise keep its own copy of
the expansion state — and the drawer's would be destroyed with the drawer, silently
losing whatever the reader had just opened. `DocNav` therefore owns the state and
hands the same one to both shells. The drawer's `open` still belongs to the host,
because the control that opens it does.

## Accessibility

- Each section's collapse control is a real `button` with `type="button"` and
  `aria-expanded`, labelled "Expand <section>" / "Collapse <section>" — the label
  names the section, so a screen-reader user moving through six controls in a row
  can tell them apart. The site's original toggle carried neither `type` nor
  `aria-expanded`; adding both is a deliberate improvement with no visual delta.
- Exactly one node in the tree carries `aria-current="page"`. The accent bar
  beside it is decoration; the attribute is what is announced.
- A directory is a link *and* a parent, so it is announced once — as a link —
  with its children as the list that follows rather than as items nested inside
  it. The tree does not read as doubly nested.
- Inlined headings are ordinary `href="…#id"` anchors, so they work with
  JavaScript off; the click handler only upgrades a same-page jump to a smooth
  scroll, and writes the hash so the position stays linkable.
- The drawer's scrim dismisses on click, but it is an `aria-hidden` `div` with no
  tab stop and no name — so the drawer offers assistive tech exactly ONE control
  named `closeLabel`. An earlier draft made the scrim a named `button` instead,
  which announced two identical controls for one action and put a viewport-sized
  button over the document; keyboard dismissal is already served by the close
  control in the drawer's own header, and by `Escape` from the host's trigger.
- The drawer is absent from the DOM when closed rather than hidden, so its links
  are never in the tab order behind the page.
- Neither frame renders a landmark. The nav column brings its own `aside` and `nav`, the rail its own `aside`, and the page's single `main` belongs to the host's app shell — so a screen-reader user gets one main region and three named ones, not a nested pair of mains.
- The breadcrumb trail is a `nav` labelled `Breadcrumb`, so assistive tech
  announces it as the trail rather than as generic links.
- The current page is a `span`, not a link — there is no self-referential link to
  land on, and the trail's end is unambiguous.
- The `/` separators are text inside the list item; they carry no role and are not
  announced as interactive.
- The frontmatter block is a real `dl`/`dt`/`dd`, so each value is announced with
  its label rather than as a run of loose text.
- Reference links that open a new tab carry `rel="noopener noreferrer"` — supplied
  by the host, since the host owns the link nodes.
- `DocArticle`'s heading structure comes from the host's rendered HTML; HDV adds no
  headings of its own and so cannot break the document outline.
- The table of contents is a real list of real `href="#id"` anchors, so it works
  with JavaScript disabled and is keyboard-navigable by default. The click handler
  only upgrades the jump to a smooth scroll.
- `prose-headings:scroll-mt-20` keeps a scrolled-to heading clear of the sticky
  header, so a keyboard user landing on an anchor sees the heading rather than the
  text beneath it.
- The marked entry is styled, not `aria-current`: the rail reflects scroll
  position, which changes continuously and is not a navigation state a screen
  reader should announce on every pixel.
- The view-source trigger is a real `button` carrying `aria-expanded` and
  `aria-controls`, so assistive tech announces both that it expands something and
  what. The site's original button carried neither — this is a deliberate
  improvement on extraction, with no visual delta.
- Its chevron is `aria-hidden`: the trigger's text already names the action, and
  the rotation is redundant with `aria-expanded`.
- The source panel is removed from the DOM when collapsed rather than hidden with
  CSS, so the document's text is never announced twice or matched twice by
  find-in-page.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | hide-empty-trail | `<DocBreadcrumbs crumbs={[]} />` | nothing rendered |
| T2 | render-crumbs-in-order | 2 crumbs | 3 `li` (home + 2) and exactly 2 `/` separators |
| T3 | render-current-page-as-text | 2 crumbs | links are `/` and the first crumb's path; the last crumb is a `span` |
| T4 | route-through-injected-link | a `LinkComponent` marking its output | every link carries the adapter's marker, and HDV's `className` survives its prop spread |
| T5 | accept-a-relabelled-home | `homeLabel="Docs" homeHref="/docs"` | first crumb reads "Docs" and points at `/docs` |
| T6 | render-trusted-html | `html="<h2 id='intro'>Intro</h2><p>Body</p>"` | an `article` containing an `h2#intro` and the body text |
| T7 | expose-the-prose-contract | `<DocArticle html="" />` | `className` equals `DOC_ARTICLE_PROSE_CLASS` exactly (nothing rewrote or reordered it) |

| T16 | hide-empty-outline | `headings={[]}`; and every id excluded | nothing rendered, both times |

| T21 | track-by-id-value | re-render with DIFFERENT ids | the first observer is disconnected and a second observes the new set |
| T22 | observe-only-existing-elements | an id with no element; then unmount | only the real element is observed; the observer disconnects |
| T23 | start-collapsed | `<ViewSourceDisclosure source={md} />` | no `pre` in the DOM and the source text is not present |
| T24 | toggle-both-ways | click, then click again | the panel appears with the source, then is removed |
| T25 | toggle-both-ways | `defaultOpen` | the panel is present on first render |
| T26 | render-source-verbatim | a source containing `<script>` | the panel's text equals the source; it has zero child ELEMENTS |

| T27b | announce-its-state | collapsed, expanded, collapsed again | `aria-controls` is ABSENT both times the panel is — no dangling IDREF |
| T28 | toggle-both-ways | activate | the chevron gains `rotate-90` only while open |
| T29 | spread-host-attributes | default, then `label` | the trigger reads "View source", then the host's label |
| T30 | spread-host-attributes | `data-testid`, `defaultOpen` | row, trigger, and panel `className`s equal their exported contracts EXACTLY |
| T31 | toggle-both-ways | `source=""` with `defaultOpen` | the panel renders and is empty — not absent |

| T33 | open-the-active-section | `activePath` = a depth-3 page | that section's pages are present; the sibling section's are not |
| T34 | open-the-active-section | `activePath` = the section itself | the section is open |
| T35 | collapse-only-the-top-level | click Expand, then Collapse | children appear, then vanish; the chevron carries `rotate-90` only while open |
| T36 | keep-the-readers-collapse-state | open a section, then re-render with a DIFFERENT `activePath` | the section is still open |
| T37 | collapse-only-the-top-level | a directory at depth 1 | its children render, and there are exactly 2 buttons — one per section, none for the directory |
| T38 | mark-the-active-page | `activePath` = a depth-3 leaf | exactly one link carries `aria-current="page"`, and it is that leaf |
| T39 | mark-the-active-page | re-render with a new `activePath` | the mark leaves the old page and lands on the new one |
| T40 | list-pages-before-directories | a host array with the directory FIRST | the rendered order is page, directory, directory's page |
| T41 | route-through-injected-link | a `LinkComponent` marking its output | every link in the tree carries the adapter's marker |
| T42 | collapse-only-the-top-level | inspect the two lists | their `className`s equal `DOC_NAV_SECTION_LIST_CLASS` and `DOC_NAV_BRANCH_LIST_CLASS` exactly |
| T43 | inline-supplied-headings | a leaf with 2 headings | both render, and the first's `href` is `<leaf>#<id>` |

| T47 | drop-the-divider-with-the-rows | 2 `topLinks` | the rows render and there is exactly one `nav > div.border-t` |
| T48 | drop-the-divider-with-the-rows | `topLinks` omitted | zero `nav > div.border-t` |
| T49 | mark-the-active-page | `activePath` equal to a fixed row's `href` | exactly one accent bar, inside that row's `h3` |
| T50 | control-the-drawer | `open` omitted | one `aside`, whose `className` equals `DOC_NAV_ASIDE_CLASS`; the `nav`'s equals `DOC_NAV_NAV_CLASS` |
| T51 | share-one-nav | `open` | two `aside`s in order [aside, drawer], and two `nav`s |
| T52 | control-the-drawer, announce-one-dismiss-control | click the scrim, then the close control | exactly ONE announced control named "Close navigation"; the scrim is an `aria-hidden` `div` with no `tabindex`; `onClose` fires twice |
| T53 | control-the-drawer | `title="Contents" closeLabel="Dismiss"` | the drawer reads "Contents" and there is exactly ONE control named "Dismiss" |
| T54 | spread-host-attributes | `className="w-96"` + `data-testid` | the column keeps `sticky`, carries `w-96`, has no `w-80`, and the attribute lands on it |
| T55 | place-the-nav-before-the-document | `nav` + children | 2 children: the nav node itself, then a region whose class equals `HIERARCHICAL_DOCUMENT_VIEW_CONTENT_CLASS` and which holds the document |
| T56 | slot-columns-unwrapped | `nav` | the nav's `parentElement` is the frame itself, so its `sticky` resolves against the frame |
| T57 | drop-an-omitted-column | no `nav` | exactly 1 child, the content region |
| T58 | render-no-landmark | `nav` + children | no `main` element and no `main` role anywhere in the output |
| T59 | spread-host-attributes | `className="gap-4"` | the frame keeps `flex-1` and gains `gap-4` |
| T60 | spread-host-attributes | `id` + `data-*` | both land on the frame |
| T61 | place-the-nav-before-the-document, cap-the-measure | `toc` + children | 2 children: the measure column holding the document, then the rail node |
| T62 | cap-the-measure | `<DocPage>{doc}</DocPage>` | `DOC_PAGE_ARTICLE_CLASS` contains both `max-w-3xl` and `min-w-0` |
| T63 | drop-an-omitted-column | no `toc` | exactly 1 child, the measure column |
| T64 | slot-columns-unwrapped | `toc` | the rail's `parentElement` is the row itself |
| T65 | spread-host-attributes | `className="items-start"` + `id` | the row keeps `flex`, gains `items-start`, and carries the `id` |
| T66 | slot-columns-unwrapped | a `DocPage` inside a `HierarchicalDocumentView` | nav → content region → row → measure → document, with the rail on the row and the nav on the frame — neither frame reaches into the other |
| T67 | mark-the-current-heading, carry-visibility-across-callbacks | ONE callback reporting `c`, `a`, `b` as entering together | `a` is marked — the first in `ids` order, not the last reported |
| T68 | carry-visibility-across-callbacks | `a` enters; `b` enters in a SECOND callback; then `a` leaves | `a`, still `a`, then `b` — `b`'s visibility survived a callback that never mentioned it |
| T69 | hold-the-last-position | the only visible heading leaves the band | the marker stays where it was rather than clearing |
| T70 | carry-visibility-across-callbacks | DOM order `b`, `a` with `ids = ['a','b']` | `a` is marked — document order comes from `ids`, not from the DOM |
| T71 | share-one-nav | expand a section in the drawer, then close the drawer | the desktop column's section is still expanded |
| T72 | route-through-injected-link | a leaf's inlined `headings` with a `LinkComponent` | the heading anchors carry the adapter's marker too — a heading link is a route, not a document load |

## Edge Cases

- **A tree 466 documents deep in places.** Only the top level latches. Cookbook's
  guidelines section alone holds hundreds of pages at depth ≥ 3; a control at every
  level would turn reaching one into four clicks, and a section the reader had just
  opened would still look empty. They pick a section; everything inside it is then
  visible.
- **A section the reader closed, and then navigated inside.** It stays closed. The
  state is derived once, at mount, and is theirs from then on.
- **A node with children whose `href` is also a real page.** A directory is both:
  its own link, then its contents. Cookbook's `/principles` is a section index page
  *and* a parent.
- **A host that sorted its nodes.** HDV re-sorts anyway — pages before directories,
  at every level — so the tree scans the same way whatever order arrives. A host
  wanting its own order has to ask, and none has (`yagni`).
- **`activePath` with a trailing slash or a query string.** Matching is exact string
  equality against `href`; anything else is simply not the active page. The host
  normalises before passing — cookbook's `usePathname()` already yields the
  canonical path.
- **No `topLinks`.** The rows and their divider both disappear, so a site whose
  whole nav is the tree gets a clean column rather than a rule with nothing above
  it.
- **The drawer's opener lives in the site header.** That is why `open` is
  controlled. An uncontrolled drawer would compile, render, and unit-test green
  while the header's hamburger did nothing — the single most likely way to get this
  component wrong, and not catchable by `DocNav`'s own tests.
- **A leaf whose `headings` name ids that are not on the page.** The click falls
  through to the anchor's default and the browser does nothing. HDV does not own the
  document, so it cannot assert the element is there.
- **The cookbook's ADR outlines.** The site's `decisionHeadings` plumbing was dead
  on arrival: `showHeadings` was passed only from a top-level section to its direct
  leaves, gated on the path `/appendix/decisions` — and a top-level section's path
  is always `/<section>`, so the gate never fired. No built page ever contained an
  outline anchor. The extraction therefore renders what the site rendered (nothing)
  and deletes the dead plumbing; `headings` stays as a capability for the first host
  that actually wants it.
- **A document set with no tree.** Omit `nav` and the frame is a single-column reader; nothing renders an empty 20rem gutter. Same for `toc` — a document with no headings gets the full width, because `DocTableOfContents` already returns nothing and the frame adds no wrapper around it.
- **A host whose app shell already renders `main`.** Every one in this family does, which is why the frame renders a `div`. A host that has *no* landmark wraps HDV in its own `main` — one line, and it owns where the landmark starts, which HDV cannot know.
- **Site root.** `crumbs: []` hides the whole nav — a lone "Home" pointing at the
  page you are on is noise, not navigation.
- **A document with no change history.** The host's split returns an empty second
  half and simply renders one `DocArticle`; HDV has no opinion about the split.
- **A frontmatter field whose value is a list.** References and tags wrap
  right-aligned rather than pushing the row off the edge.
- **Non-URL citations.** Books and papers are cited in prose ("Osborn, *Applied
  Imagination*, 1953"); an `<a href>` around one points nowhere, so the host decides
  per item whether it is a link. HDV renders whatever nodes it is given.
- **Heading ids.** Anchors come from the host's markdown slugger (cookbook uses
  `rehype-slug`). HDV takes them as given — a change to that slug config silently
  breaks scroll-to-heading without HDV changing.
- **Untrusted HTML.** `DocArticle` uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and does no
  escaping. See Configuration.
- **A document with one heading.** The rail still renders — a one-entry outline is
  the honest answer, and suppressing it would make the layout jump between pages.
- **A heading id with no element.** The spy skips it; the entry still renders and
  its anchor simply does nothing. HDV does not own the document, so it cannot
  assert the element exists.
- **Two headings visible at once.** The FIRST in `ids` order wins — the reader's
  position is the topmost heading they can see. Taking the last one the observer
  mentioned instead makes the marker depend on scroll direction and on batching:
  a callback reports only what CHANGED, so scrolling up (where the heading that
  changed is the *higher* one) and scrolling down disagree about the same viewport.
- **No heading visible at all.** The marker holds its last position. A reader
  between two headings, or inside one long section, is still somewhere — clearing
  the rail there would blank it for most of a long document.
- **A host that renders its own headings client-side.** The spy resolves elements
  by id when it subscribes; content appearing later is not observed until the ids
  change.
- **A document whose source contains HTML.** `ViewSourceDisclosure` is the one
  block in the family that does *not* trust its input: the source is a text child
  of a `<pre>`, so markup is shown rather than executed. It is safe to point at
  content `DocArticle` would not be.
- **A very long source.** The panel grows with the document rather than scrolling
  internally — the reader who asked for the source wants all of it, and a nested
  scroll region inside a scrolling page is a trap. Only over-wide lines scroll.
- **An empty source.** The panel still renders. A document with no body still has
  a source, and a toggle that opened onto nothing would read as broken.
- **A host that wants the source open by default.** `defaultOpen` seeds the state;
  the reader owns it from then on. There is deliberately no controlled mode until
  a host needs one (`yagni`).

## Configuration

| Component | Prop | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HierarchicalDocumentView` | `nav` | none | the nav column, normally a `DocNav`; rendered unwrapped, omit for a single-column reader |
| | `children` | — | the routed document region: one `DocPage` per route |
| `DocPage` | `toc` | none | the right rail, normally a `DocTableOfContents`; rendered unwrapped, omit to give the document the full width |
| | `children` | — | the document: breadcrumbs, article, metadata, source |
| `DocNavTree` | `nodes` | — | top-level sections in display order; each `{ label, href, headings?, children? }` |
| | `activePath` | — | the current route, spelled exactly as it appears in a node's `href` |
| | `LinkComponent` | `DefaultDocLink` | the host's router link, taking `to` |
| | `expandedSections` | none | the open sections' `href`s, when a caller owns the state; omit and the tree keeps its own |
| | `onToggleSection` | none | called with a section's `href` when its control is used; pass it with `expandedSections` |
| `DocNav` | `nodes` / `activePath` / `LinkComponent` | — | passed straight through to `DocNavTree` |
| | `topLinks` | `[]` | fixed `{ label, href }` rows above the tree; empty drops their divider too |
| | `open` | `false` | whether the mobile drawer is showing — controlled, always |
| | `onClose` | none | called from the close control and from the scrim |
| | `title` | `"Navigation"` | the drawer's heading |
| | `closeLabel` | `"Close navigation"` | accessible name for the drawer's close control; the scrim is `aria-hidden` and takes no name |
| `DocBreadcrumbs` | `crumbs` | — | `{ label, path }[]`, root-first; the last is the current page |
| | `homeLabel` | `"Home"` | label for the fixed first crumb |
| | `homeHref` | `"/"` | destination for the fixed first crumb |
| | `LinkComponent` | `DefaultDocLink` | the host's router link, taking `to` |
| `DocArticle` | `html` | — | pre-rendered, already-trusted document HTML |
| | `as` | `"article"` | `article` for a document, `div`/`section` for a fragment |
| `DocMetadata` | `fields` | — | `{ label, value }[]` in display order; an array `value` renders as a wrapping group |
| `DocTableOfContents` | `headings` | — | `{ id, text, depth }[]` in document order, as the host's loader extracted them |
| | `excludeIds` | none | ids to leave out; omit to list everything |
| | `title` | `"On this page"` | the rail's own label |
| `ViewSourceDisclosure` | `source` | — | the raw document text; rendered verbatim, never parsed |
| | `label` | `"View source"` | the trigger's text |
| | `defaultOpen` | `false` | start expanded; uncontrolled from then on |
| `useScrollSpy` | `ids` | — | element ids to watch, in document order |
| | `rootMargin` | `"-80px 0px -60% 0px"` | the band that counts as "here": discounts a sticky header at the top and the lower 60% |
| | `threshold` | `0` | any visible pixel counts |

⚠️ **`DocArticle` is trusted-input only.** `html` goes through
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, so it must be markup the host itself produced — a
build-time markdown render of files in its own repo, say. Never pass
user-submitted or third-party HTML without sanitising it first; HDV does no
escaping and cannot.

The host derives `crumbs` itself rather than HDV deriving them from a slug: every
site slices its URL space differently (cookbook title-cases domain segments; another
site would look labels up in a manifest), and deriving them here would bake one
site's URL convention into the toolkit.

## Logging

None. The centre-column components are pure render functions. The table of
contents' only effect is an `IntersectionObserver` subscription with no network,
no persistence, and no error path — there is nothing to log that the host's own
render tracing would not already show.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: Start from a `NavigationSplitView` with the nav tree as the sidebar
  and the document content as the detail column. Build the tree from nested
  `DisclosureGroup` views (top-level sections only expand/collapse; deeper levels
  render flat inside an open group, per the behavioral requirements) inside a
  `List`. Breadcrumbs: an `HStack` of `Button`/`Text` pairs separated by `/`
  `Text` views. Metadata: a `Grid` with two columns (label, value) mimicking the
  `dl`/`dt`/`dd` contract. Table of contents: a second `List` bound to the
  scrollspy's active id, shown or hidden with a plain `if`/`isPresented`
  condition rather than a disabled state. View source: a `DisclosureGroup`
  wrapping a monospaced, wrapping `Text`. On mobile widths, present the nav tree
  as a `.sheet` with `accessibilityAddTraits(.isModal)`, move focus into it on
  open with `@AccessibilityFocusState`, and dismiss on a `.keyboardShortcut(.escape)`
  action alongside the visible close button.
- **Compose**: Start from a `Row` with a collapsible nav `Column` (a `LazyColumn`
  of top-level sections, each an `ExpandableItem`-style composable driven by a
  single `remember { mutableStateOf(...) }` per section — only the top level
  toggles; deeper levels render flat while their section is expanded) and the
  document content in a second `Column`. Breadcrumbs: a `Row` of `Text`/
  `TextButton` separated by `/` `Text`. Metadata: a two-column `Row` per entry
  inside a `Column`, mirroring `dl`/`dt`/`dd`. Table of contents: a second
  `LazyColumn` bound to the scrollspy's active id, shown or hidden with
  conditional composition (`if (showToc) { ... }`), not a disabled modifier.
  View source: an expandable card holding a monospaced, wrapping `Text`. On
  mobile widths, present the nav tree in a `ModalNavigationDrawer` or
  `ModalBottomSheet`, request focus into it on open, and close it on back-press
  or a visible close action in addition to a scrim tap.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: On macOS, an `NSSplitViewController` with an
  `NSOutlineView` sidebar (top-level rows collapse/expand via
  `NSOutlineView` disclosure triangles; deeper rows stay flat once their
  parent is expanded) and the document content in the detail pane. On iOS, a
  `UISplitViewController` with a `UITableView` (grouped, disclosure-style
  sections) as the primary column. Breadcrumbs: a horizontal stack of buttons
  and separator labels. Metadata: a two-column `UIStackView`/`NSStackView`
  layout per entry. Table of contents: a second table/outline view bound to
  the scrollspy's active id, shown or hidden via `isHidden`, not `isEnabled`.
  View source: a disclosure-style cell revealing a monospaced, wrapping text
  view. On mobile widths, present the nav tree as a sheet or a
  `UISplitViewController` compact-mode overlay with `accessibilityViewIsModal`,
  move focus into it on open with `UIAccessibility.post(notification: .screenChanged, ...)`,
  and dismiss it on both a visible close control and the standard interactive
  dismiss gesture.
- **WinUI 3**: Start from a `NavigationView` with its pane holding the document
  structure and the document content region in the main area. Because only the
  top level collapses, render the pane as a stack of `Expander` controls — one
  per top-level section — each wrapping a flat, always-expanded `ItemsRepeater`
  for that section's deeper levels; a plain `TreeView` is the wrong control here
  because it puts an expander at every depth. Breadcrumbs: render as
  `StackPanel (Horizontal)` with `TextBlock` and `HyperlinkButton` elements
  separated by `/` `TextBlock`s. Metadata: use a `ListView` or custom
  `ItemsControl` with a two-column `DataTemplate` (label on left, value on
  right) mimicking the `dl`/`dt`/`dd` contract. Table of contents: render as a
  second pane bound to the scrollspy's active id, shown or hidden by binding
  `Visibility` (not `IsEnabled`, which leaves it visible but inert) to the
  viewport-width equivalent. View source: use an `Expander` control with a
  `TextBlock` child and `TextWrapping="Wrap"` for the source panel. Apply the
  ADH theme's color tokens as markup extensions in your app's resource
  dictionary, e.g. `{ThemeResource ColorTextPrimary}`, `{ThemeResource ColorAccent}`.
  Drawer for mobile-equivalent: use `NavigationView` with
  `PaneDisplayMode="LeftMinimal"` or `"LeftCompact"` triggered by window width.
  When the breadcrumbs already provide a route back to the parent document,
  set `IsBackButtonVisible="Collapsed"` so the two controls do not duplicate
  back-navigation; otherwise bind it to the last breadcrumb's route so the
  back button and the breadcrumb trail land on the same destination. Visual
  states: use `VisualStateManager` to control chevron rotation in collapse
  buttons via `RotateTransform`, and accent-bar appearance via conditional
  rendering. XAML pattern: compose the layout as a nested `Grid` with
  row/column definitions for the three-column structure, with a
  `ScrollViewer` wrapping the document content to handle long articles.
- **React/Web**: `packages/web/packages/ui/src/blocks/doc-breadcrumbs.tsx`, `doc-article.tsx`, `doc-metadata.tsx`, `doc-table-of-contents.tsx`, `view-source-disclosure.tsx`, `doc-nav.tsx`, `hierarchical-document-view.tsx`, `doc-link.tsx`, and the shared types in `doc-types.ts`. Exported from `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks`. `useScrollSpy` lives at `src/hooks/useScrollSpy.ts` and needed its own `./hooks/useScrollSpy` key in the package's `exports` map: unlike `./components/*` and `./blocks/*`, `./hooks/*` is not a wildcard, so a new hook is unreachable until its key exists. `doc-types.ts` is a `.ts` file, so the package's `./blocks/*` export wildcard (which resolves `.tsx` only) does not reach it; the `./blocks` barrel is its one public import path. No `transpilePackages` needed — a Next consumer resolves the package's `development` condition to raw `src/` under `next dev` and `import` to `dist/` in a production build. Tailwind classes are self-registered by `src/styles/components.css` (`@source "../blocks/**/*.{ts,tsx}"`). First consumer: an internal docs site's entry view and layout chrome. Implementation details: the two frames go in different files on purpose — `HierarchicalDocumentView` belongs in the host's layout and `DocPage` in its page; putting the nav in the page remounts the tree on every navigation. Demo: `ui-showcase` Topic `hierarchical-document-view`. Responsive: verify at 375 / 768 / 1440px that breadcrumbs wrap and metadata stays right-aligned.

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: HDV is a new block family rather than a mode of
  `HierarchicalTopicDetail`. **Rationale**: `TopicDetailItem` is flat, so HTDV
  cannot represent a nested document tree without changing its core type; and the
  two lay out differently (stacked panes vs. one nested column). Forcing them
  together would couple two shapes that change for different reasons
  (`separation-of-concerns`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the router is injected as `LinkComponent`, and the current route
  arrives as a plain `activePath` string. **Rationale**: importing `next/link` would
  make the package unusable outside Next and untestable without a router harness.
  Passing `to` rather than `href` makes the adapter an explicit mapping instead of
  an accidental structural match with `<a>` (`explicit-over-implicit`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: types are re-declared here rather than imported from
  `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/model`. **Rationale**: `model` is not in the consuming build's
  package filter, its `NavNode` lacks the fields HDV needs, and it also exports a
  whole alternate site-shell framework — depending on it would re-couple consumers,
  by the back door, to the lineage cookbook deliberately forked away from. Two type
  declarations is the cheaper, more reversible trade
  (`small-reversible-decisions`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: `DocMetadata` takes rendered `{ label, value }` pairs, not a
  frontmatter object. **Rationale**: which fields exist, how they format, and which
  are links is site vocabulary. Keeping it out means adding a field to a site never
  touches the toolkit (`srp` — the block answers to layout, not to any one site's
  schema).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the change-history table stays a second `DocArticle` rather than
  becoming a `DataTable`. **Rationale**: it arrives as markdown-rendered HTML inside
  the document; converting it would need a new loader-side GFM-table parser and
  would visibly change the rendered output — a redesign, which this extraction
  explicitly is not (`yagni`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the table of contents filters by an `excludeIds` prop rather than
  knowing which headings are chrome. **Rationale**: cookbook hides its change
  history because it relocates it below the frontmatter; another host will want it
  listed. Baking one site's convention in would make the block wrong for the second
  consumer, and the default — filter nothing — is the one with no opinion in it
  (`explicit-over-implicit`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: `useScrollSpy` keys its effect on the ids' joined VALUE, not the
  array's identity. **Rationale**: every real caller derives its ids inline
  (`headings.filter(...)`), producing a fresh array each render; keying on identity
  would tear the observer down and rebuild it on every render, losing the marked
  heading. The site's original component sidestepped this by depending on an
  unfiltered prop, which is a coincidence rather than a contract
  (`principle-of-least-astonishment`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the rail's entry classes are composed with a template literal, not
  `cn()`. **Rationale**: `tailwind-merge` cannot reliably tell `border-l` (a width)
  from `border-[var(--color-accent)]` (a colour), and dropping either would cost the
  marker. Nothing merges a host class onto the entries, so `cn()` buys nothing there
  — it is still used on the root, where the host's `className` does merge.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: `ViewSourceDisclosure` does **not** compose the toolkit's existing
  `Disclosure`. **Rationale**: `Disclosure` is a framed card — rounded border,
  raised surface, padded header, `text-sm font-medium` title, a ruled content box —
  and that is exactly what its other consumers (the API
  explorer's three panels, the showcase, and a settings-pane danger-zone
  disclosure) want. This row is the opposite: a hairline
  rule *above* a mono micro-label, with an unframed `<pre>` beneath. Reaching it
  through `Disclosure` would mean cancelling every visual decision it makes — card
  chrome, header padding, chevron size and colour, title family/size/weight/colour,
  content frame: nine overrides to keep about twenty lines of open/close state, plus
  a standing coupling that would let a future `Disclosure` restyle silently break
  the document reader. When every visual property must be cancelled, you are paying
  a component's cost and taking none of its value. Two disclosures is not a `dry`
  violation either: `dry` is one representation per piece of *knowledge*, and a
  framed section and an inline text toggle are different knowledge
  (`srp` — `Disclosure` stays answerable to its card consumers alone).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: no `bare` / `contentClassName` escape hatches were added to
  `Disclosure`. **Rationale**: they were the plan of record until the two components
  were compared line by line. Once HDV stopped composing `Disclosure`, they would
  have been props with no caller — speculative surface on a primitive three things
  depend on (`yagni`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the chevron is lucide's `ChevronRight`, not the site's inline
  `<svg>`. **Rationale**: the toolkit already depends on lucide and every other
  block draws from it; copying a bespoke path in would fork the icon set. The cost
  is one pixel of glyph width at `h-3 w-3` (lucide's chevron spans 6 units of its
  24-unit box where the site's spanned 7) — the extraction's single recorded visual
  delta, named in the Overview so it reads as a decision rather than as drift.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` were added, which the site's
  button lacked. **Rationale**: a control that reveals a region must say so; the
  omission was a bug, and fixing it costs nothing visually. "A move, not a
  redesign" constrains the *rendering*, not the semantics.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the panel is removed from the DOM when collapsed rather than hidden
  with CSS. **Rationale**: the source is the same text as the rendered document.
  Keeping a hidden copy would double every document's text for find-in-page, screen
  readers, and any crawler that ignores `display:none` (`explicit-over-implicit`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: `ViewSourceDisclosure` owns the `<pre>` rather than taking
  `children`. **Rationale**: the panel's typography *is* part of the reader's
  contract, and every host revealing a document's source wants the same box. A
  `children` slot would push that decision to each site and let them drift
  (`dry`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: only the top level of the tree collapses; every directory below it
  is always expanded. **Rationale**: the site's rules doc demanded "if a section has
  ANY sub-items, it MUST be toggleable. No exceptions" — and the site's code has
  never done that, because `DirLink` renders its children unconditionally. The code
  is right. Cookbook holds 466 documents, most at depth ≥ 3; a latch at every level
  makes reaching a page four clicks and makes a section the reader just opened still
  look empty. The rules doc was corrected to match the code, not the reverse
  (`principle-of-least-astonishment`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: a section's expanded state is seeded from `activePath` at mount and
  owned by the reader afterwards. **Rationale**: deriving it on every render is the
  obvious implementation and it is wrong — it slams a section shut under a reader
  who opened it to browse while standing on a page elsewhere. Seeding once is the
  only version where the control does what its user just asked it to.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the tree re-sorts a node's children — pages before directories —
  rather than honouring the host's array order. **Rationale**: this is the site's
  existing behaviour (`NavSection` and `DirLink` each partition their children), and
  it is what makes every level scan the same way. Making it a prop would be surface
  with no caller (`yagni`); if a host ever needs its own order, deleting the
  partition is a smaller change than removing a knob.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the mobile drawer's `open` is controlled, with no uncontrolled
  fallback. **Rationale**: the button that opens it is in the site header, outside
  HDV's subtree. An uncontrolled drawer would compile, render, and test green while
  the header's hamburger did nothing (`explicit-over-implicit`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: `onClose`, not `onOpenChange`. **Rationale**: nothing inside
  `DocNav` ever opens the drawer — the opener is the host's. A callback that can
  only ever be called with `false` should not take an argument
  (`explicit-over-implicit`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: `HdvNavNode` has no `id` and no `trailing` slot, and its `href` is
  required. **Rationale**: all three were in the plan of record. `href` already
  identifies a node uniquely — it is a URL — so an `id` would be a second key to
  keep in step; no host has a badge to hang on a nav row; and every node in a
  document tree is a real page, since a directory is its own index. Admitting a
  destination-less group would put an `href ? link : span` branch at three levels of
  the tree to serve a shape nothing produces. All three are additive later
  (`yagni`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: there is no `collapsibleDepth` knob. **Rationale**: its only honest
  values are "top level only" — what every host wants — and "all levels", what
  nothing wants per the decision above. If uniform toggling ever becomes right, the
  change is to delete the level switch, not to expose it as configuration.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the site's `data-autoscroll="true"` attribute on the nav is dropped.
  **Rationale**: nothing in the repo reads it — no CSS rule, no script, no test. It
  was a hook for a scroll-into-view behaviour that was never built
  (`design-for-deletion`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: cookbook's `decisionHeadings` side-channel is deleted rather than
  ported. **Rationale**: it was dead code, verified against the built HTML — no page
  contained an outline anchor — because `showHeadings` was passed only from a
  top-level section to its direct leaves when that section's path was
  `/appendix/decisions`, and a top-level section's path is always `/<section>`.
  Porting a feature that never rendered would be inventing one. HDV keeps the
  `headings` capability, tested and documented, for the first host that wants it;
  whether cookbook should now turn its ADR outlines **on** is a visible product
  change and the site owner's call, not the extraction's.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: a mid-tree directory renders its link and its child list as two
  SIBLING `<li>`s rather than nesting the list inside the item. **Rationale**: this
  is the site's markup and it is load-bearing — the child list's rule starts at the
  parent's left edge instead of inside its list item, which is what makes the rails
  stack one indent apart down the column. Nesting would shift every rule right by a
  text indent.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the site's three mutually-recursive nav functions (`NavSection`,
  `DirLink`, `FileLink`) collapse into one recursive component whose rendering is
  chosen by depth and by `children.length`. **Rationale**: the three shared a
  `showHeadings` side-channel and duplicated the pages-before-directories partition
  twice; one component keyed on where a node *sits* has a single copy of each
  (`dry`, `simplicity`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: `DocBreadcrumbs` takes resolved crumbs instead of a slug.
  **Rationale**: slug→label is a per-site URL convention; deriving it here would
  make the toolkit wrong for the second consumer (`dry` — the convention has one
  home, in the site that owns the URLs).
  **Approved**: pending

- **Decision**: the frame is two components — `HierarchicalDocumentView` and
  `DocPage` — rather than one taking three slots. **Rationale**: the three columns
  do not live in one place. The nav persists across navigations and belongs to the
  host's layout; the article and rail are the page. A single component taking all
  three would force the nav into the page, remounting the tree on every route change
  and resetting the reader's expanded sections. The split follows the React boundary
  that already exists (`separation-of-concerns`), and the seam is where the host
  already has one.
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the content region is a `div` and the frames render no landmark.
  **Rationale**: the site nested a second `main` inside its app shell's, which is
  invalid; baking that into the toolkit would spread it to every consumer. Landmarks
  are a whole-page concern the host owns, and HDV cannot know where the page's main
  region begins (`separation-of-concerns`, `principle-of-least-astonishment`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: the frames take slots and a `className`, and nothing else — no
  `contentClassName`, no `articleClassName`, no configurable gap. **Rationale**: the
  exported class constants are the escape hatch already, and every knob added here is
  a way for a consumer to disagree with the measure that is the block's reason to
  exist (`yagni`, `simplicity`).
  **Approved**: pending
- **Decision**: a slotted column is rendered unwrapped. **Rationale**: `DocNav` and
  `DocTableOfContents` are `sticky` with their own header-height offsets, which
  resolve against their sticky containing block. Any wrapper the frame added — even
  a bare, non-scrolling `div` — would silently become that containing block, clamping
  how far the column can stick to the wrapper's own bounds, and both columns would
  stop holding position with no error to explain it (`explicit-over-implicit`).
  **Approved**: pending

Statuses rest on `hierarchical-document-view.tsx` and the components it composes:
frontmatter carries every required field; the breadcrumb `nav`, `dl` metadata,
real anchors in the outline, `type="button"` collapse controls, and the single
non-duplicated landmark ground `semantic-markup` as passed; `aria-expanded` /
`aria-controls` on the view-source and collapse controls, `aria-hidden` on the
chevron and scrim, the IDREF that only exists while its referent does, and the
drawer's removal from the DOM when closed ground `screen-reader-support` as
passed; native buttons, links and anchors throughout ground `keyboard-navigable`
as passed; the flat `--color-*` token family grounds `contrast-ratio` as
partial, since the source cannot show computed contrast values; the view-source
panel renders raw text while `DocArticle`'s HTML path is documented as
trusted-input only rather than type-enforced, grounding `input-sanitization` as
partial; and the single recursive tree component, the injected `LinkComponent`
(no `next/link` coupling), and the one collapse state hoisted above both the
drawer and the column ground `separation-of-concerns` as passed.

## Change History

| Version | Date | Author | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.7.0 | 2026-09-22 | Mike Fullerton | Lint pass: renamed every requirement to subject-only kebab-case with no `must-`/`should-` prefix everywhere it is cited; corrected the unwrapped-slot rationale to name the sticky containing block rather than the scrolling ancestor; reworded the `render-no-landmark` requirement from an ambiguous "neither... MUST" to "each frame MUST NOT", and named the components `spread-host-attributes` covers; added an `**Approved**: pending` line to every Design Decision; reformatted Compliance into a linked table of real catalog checks with `passed`/`partial` statuses and a grounding sentence; rewrote Platform Notes to the convention's five bullets (SwiftUI, Compose, React/Web, AppKit / UIKit, WinUI 3) with real SwiftUI/Compose guidance and an added AppKit/UIKit bullet, and fixed WinUI 3's top-level-only expander control, `Visibility` binding, `{ThemeResource ...}` syntax, and back-button/breadcrumb coordination; shortened the frontmatter summary to one line; gave T62 and T31 their missing/corrected inputs and requirement mapping. |
| 1.5.1 | 2026-09-22 | Mike Fullerton | Restructured Platform Notes section with platform-specific bullets for each supported platform (iOS, macOS, Android, Windows, Web), improving recipe clarity and following cookbook guidelines for platform translation guidance. |
| 1.5.0 | 2026-07-29 | Mike Fullerton | Hardened the extraction against four defects a code review found, each with the rule and vectors that pin it: the drawer and the desktop column are two INSTANCES of one element description, so they now share one collapse state hoisted into `DocNav` — before, a section opened in the drawer was lost the moment the drawer closed; the scrim stops being a viewport-sized named `button` and becomes an `aria-hidden` `div`, leaving exactly one announced dismiss control; `useScrollSpy` carries visibility across callbacks and resolves the marked heading by the order of `ids`, because an `IntersectionObserver` batch reports only what CHANGED and guarantees nothing about order — taking the last entry made the rail depend on scroll direction; and `aria-controls` on the view-source trigger appears only while the panel does, since an IDREF pointing at nothing is an axe `aria-valid-attr-value` error. An inlined heading link now routes through `LinkComponent` too, instead of forcing a document load to reach a heading already on screen. |
| 1.4.0 | 2026-07-29 | Mike Fullerton | Completed the reader with the frame that places its columns: `HierarchicalDocumentView` (the nav, then the document region) wrapping `DocPage` (the `max-w-3xl` measure, then the rail). Two components rather than one, because the nav belongs to the host's persistent layout and the document to its page — one component would remount the tree on every navigation. Both are slot-only and render no landmark, which retires a pre-existing bug: the cookbook site nested a second `main` inside its app shell's. `EntryView` and `LayoutChrome` are now compositions of toolkit blocks with no layout of their own. |
| 1.3.0 | 2026-07-29 | Mike Fullerton | Added the left column: `DocNavTree`, the collapsible multi-depth document tree, and `DocNav`, the sticky desktop aside and controlled mobile drawer that carry it — ported from the cookbook site's `Sidebar`, which is deleted. The site's three mutually-recursive nav functions collapse into one recursive component; its dead `decisionHeadings` side-channel is deleted rather than ported, because it never rendered, and the unread `data-autoscroll` attribute goes with it. Parity was measured, not asserted: a constant 1105-byte delta across four pre/post pages, resolving to the lucide chevron plus the `type="button"` and `aria-expanded` the original toggle lacked. |
| 1.2.0 | 2026-07-29 | Mike Fullerton | Added `ViewSourceDisclosure`, the "View source" row that closes the centre column, ported from the cookbook site's `RawMarkdownToggle`. It deliberately does NOT compose the existing `Disclosure` — see Design Decisions — and gains `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`, which the original lacked. One recorded visual delta: lucide's chevron replaces the hand-rolled inline SVG. |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-07-29 | Mike Fullerton | Added the right rail: `DocTableOfContents` and `useScrollSpy`, ported from the cookbook site's `TableOfContents`. Its `HIDDEN_HEADINGS` set became the `excludeIds` prop, passed from the host — so the toolkit holds no opinion about which headings are chrome. |
| 1.0.0 | 2026-07-29 | Mike Fullerton | Initial recipe. HDV's centre column — `DocBreadcrumbs`, `DocArticle`, `DocMetadata` (plus `DefaultDocLink` and the shared `doc-types`) — extracted verbatim from the cookbook site's reader. |
