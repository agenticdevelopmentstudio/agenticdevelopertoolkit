# OptionMenu

## Overview

`OptionMenu` is a single-select "popup menu": a trigger button that discloses a
list of choices with full keyboard navigation, plus an optional editable
**"Other"** item as the last entry. It is a general-purpose popup menu for forms
(example: a "How did you hear about us?" field with a free-text fallback). It
is built by composing existing primitives — `Popover` (surface), `Input` (the
Other field), `Button` (the OK affordance) — with a hand-managed roving
**selection** so the keyboard model below is exact. It deliberately does **not**
build on `DropdownMenu` / Base-UI menu: menu roles hijack typeahead and focus and
fight an embedded text input. It is distinct from the rail filter `PopupMenu`
block (`@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks/popup-menu`), which keeps its own `allLabel`/`onNew`
filter semantics and is unchanged.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **trigger-opens-on-activation**: When the trigger is focused, Enter / Space / ArrowDown MUST open the surface.
- **open-initializes-selection**: On open, the highlighted selection MUST initialize to the committed item if any, else to the first item (see **other-input-focused-on-open** for where keyboard focus lands when `allowOther`, which is independent of this highlight).
- **arrow-nav-clamps**: When open, ArrowDown / ArrowUp MUST move the selection down/up, clamped at the ends (no wrap).
- **enter-commits-list-item**: When a list item is selected, Enter MUST commit it via `onChange` with `isOther:false`, then close and return focus to the trigger.
- **pointer-click-commits**: A pointer click on a row MUST commit that row immediately and close.
- **escape-closes-without-commit**: Esc MUST close the surface without firing `onChange`.
- **click-outside-closes-without-commit**: A pointer press outside the surface MUST close it without firing `onChange`, inherited from the `Popover` primitive's default outside-press behavior.
- **tab-unsupported**: The surface does not trap focus and defines no Tab handling; Tab is left to native browser focus order rather than a menu-style focus trap.
- **home-end-unsupported**: Home and End are not handled; they have no effect on the selection.
- **typeahead-unsupported**: Character keys do not perform typeahead selection, per the Overview's rationale for not building on menu roles.
- **focus-returns-on-close**: On any close, focus MUST return to the trigger.
- **selection-not-commit**: Changing the roving selection MUST NOT fire `onChange`; only a commit (Enter, OK, or row click) fires it.
- **check-marks-committed-value**: While open, the check (✓) MUST mark the committed value.
- **resolves-committed-value**: The committed value MUST resolve as follows: an item whose `value` matches wins; else, when `allowOther` and `value` is non-null, Other wins and its input prefills with `value`; else nothing is committed.
- **other-input-focused-on-open**: When `allowOther`, the Other input MUST receive focus immediately on open (caret ready to type), regardless of which row **open-initializes-selection** highlights — keyboard focus and the roving highlight are independent and need not point at the same row.
- **typing-moves-check-to-other**: Typing in the Other input MUST set the selection to Other and move the check to Other live, before commit.
- **ok-enabled-when-nonempty**: The OK button MUST be enabled iff the Other input is non-empty after trim.
- **arrowup-from-other-moves-to-list**: ArrowUp from the Other input MUST move the selection to the last list item above Other and blur the input.
- **arrowdown-from-last-item-to-other**: ArrowDown from the last list item MUST return the selection to Other and re-focus the input.
- **enter-commits-other-when-nonempty**: When Other is the active selection and its input is non-empty, Enter MUST commit the trimmed text via `onChange` with `isOther:true`, then close.
- **enter-noop-when-other-empty**: When Other is active but the input is empty, Enter MUST be a no-op (matching the disabled OK).
- **ok-equals-enter-for-other**: Clicking OK MUST be equivalent to Enter while Other is active with non-empty input.
- **disabled-blocks-interaction**: When `disabled`, the trigger MUST NOT open the surface; the disabled trigger is skipped by both pointer and keyboard (a disabled `<button>` receives neither).

## Appearance

Closed:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Search engine            ▾  │   ← trigger button (label = current value or placeholder) + chevron
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Open, no "Other":

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Search engine            ▴  │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ ✓ Search engine             │   ← checkmark = committed value
│   Social media              │   ← highlighted row = roving selection
│   Blog post                 │
│   Newsletter                │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Open, with editable "Other" as the last item:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Search engine             │
│   …                         │
│   Word of mouth             │
│ ✓ Other                     │   ← check moves here once the user types
│   [                      ]  │   ← text input — focused on open
│   [          OK          ]  │   ← disabled until the input is non-empty
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

- Trigger: same visual language as `Select`/`Input` — surface-role border and background, focus ring in the accent tone, chevron icon in the muted-text tone.
- Surface: `Popover` content; rows use the dropdown row treatment — highlighted row uses the accent tone at low opacity, text in the default tone, check icon in the accent tone.
- Other input: shared `Input`. OK: shared `Button`, small size, accent (default) variant, full width of the surface, `disabled` when empty.
- Spacing from the standard space scale; small corner radius. No raw hex values; no style overrides that bypass the token system.

See **React/Web** under Platform Notes for the concrete design tokens this implementation uses.

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|---|---|
| Trigger closed | label = committed value or placeholder; chevron down |
| Trigger focused | `focus-visible` ring `apt-gold/25` |
| Trigger disabled | dimmed; non-interactive |
| Open, no selection committed | no row checked; first row highlighted (or Other, if there are no items and `allowOther`); when `allowOther`, keyboard focus moves to the Other input regardless of which row is highlighted |
| Open, row highlighted | `bg-apt-gold/15` on the roving row |
| Open, committed row | ✓ on the committed row |
| Other empty | OK disabled |
| Other non-empty | OK enabled; ✓ on Other |

## Accessibility

- Trigger: `<button>` with `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-label={ariaLabel}`.
- Surface: the `role="listbox"` container itself (not a row) owns `aria-activedescendant`, pointing at the currently highlighted option's `id`; rows are `role="option"` with `aria-selected` on the committed row and `data-highlighted` on the selection.
- Other row: also `role="option"`, `aria-selected` mirroring whether Other is committed; it additionally contains a labeled `<input>` (`aria-label` from `otherLabel`) and the OK `<button>` (`aria-disabled` mirrors `disabled`) — an option row with focusable descendants, which departs from a plain listbox/option tree (see **screen-reader-support** in Compliance).
- Focus returns to the trigger on close.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | arrow-nav-clamps, enter-commits-list-item | open, ArrowDown ×2, Enter | the right item commits, surface closes |
| T2 | escape-closes-without-commit | open, Esc | no `onChange`; trigger refocused |
| T3 | pointer-click-commits | click a row | that row commits, closes |
| T4 | other-input-focused-on-open | open with `allowOther` | Other input is focused |
| T5 | ok-enabled-when-nonempty | type into Other | OK enabled; empty → disabled |
| T6 | typing-moves-check-to-other | type into Other | check moves to Other |
| T7 | enter-commits-other-when-nonempty | type "Foo", Enter | commits "Foo" with `isOther:true` |
| T8 | arrowup-from-other-moves-to-list | ArrowUp from Other input | selection to last list item; input blurred |
| T9 | resolves-committed-value, check-marks-committed-value | controlled `value` = an item | that item resolves checked |
| T10 | resolves-committed-value, check-marks-committed-value | controlled `value` = Other free text | Other checked, input prefilled |
| T11 | trigger-opens-on-activation | trigger focused and closed, Enter (also Space, ArrowDown) | surface opens |
| T12 | focus-returns-on-close | open, Escape | no `onChange`; DOM focus returns to the trigger |
| T13 | selection-not-commit | open, ArrowDown to move the highlight, no further key | no `onChange` fired |
| T14 | arrowdown-from-last-item-to-other | open with `allowOther`, ArrowDown to the last list item, ArrowDown again | selection moves to Other; input re-focused |
| T15 | enter-noop-when-other-empty | Other active, input empty, Enter | no `onChange`; surface stays open |
| T16 | ok-equals-enter-for-other | type "Foo" into Other, click OK | commits "Foo" with `isOther:true`, identical to Enter (T7) |
| T17 | arrow-nav-clamps | open (no `allowOther`), ArrowUp while the first item is highlighted | highlight stays on the first item (no wrap) |
| T18 | arrow-nav-clamps | open (no `allowOther`), ArrowDown while the last item is highlighted | highlight stays on the last item (no wrap) |
| T19 | open-initializes-selection | open with a committed item, before any key press | that item is highlighted immediately (independent of T9's check) |

## Edge Cases

- **Value resolution** (see **resolves-committed-value**). If `value` equals some `items[i].value`, that item is the committed/checked row. Else if `allowOther` and `value` is non-null, Other is the committed row and its input prefills with `value`. Else nothing is checked.
- Free text identical to an item value resolves to the item; callers needing to distinguish should avoid colliding labels.
- `value = null` → nothing is checked.
- `allowOther = false` with no matching item → nothing is checked.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `items` | `OptionMenuItem[]` | — | The selectable items (`{ value, label }`). |
| `value` | `string \| null` | — | Committed value: an item value, free text (when `allowOther`), or null. |
| `onChange` | `(value: string, meta: { isOther: boolean }) => void` | — | Fired on commit; `isOther` true when from the Other input. |
| `allowOther` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables the editable Other row. |
| `otherLabel` | `string` | `"Other"` | Label for the Other row. |
| `otherPlaceholder` | `string` | — | Placeholder for the Other input. |
| `placeholder` | `string` | — | Trigger text when `value` is null. |
| `ariaLabel` | `string` | — | Required; labels the trigger + listbox. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables the control. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Extra classes. |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: This is a UI component, not a full application feature that requires deep linking.

## Localization

Most user-facing strings are passed via props (`ariaLabel`, `otherLabel`, `placeholder`, `otherPlaceholder`), letting callers localize at point of use. The **OK** button's label is the exception: it is hard-coded as `"OK"` with no prop to override it, so a caller cannot localize that one string (see **no-hardcoded-strings** in Compliance).

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: This component uses no animations that respond to accessibility preferences.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: This is a library component with no feature-flag gating.

## Analytics

Not applicable: This is a presentational form control that does not emit analytics events.

## Privacy

Not applicable: This component handles no sensitive data and emits no telemetry.

## Logging

No logging. OptionMenu is a presentational form control; it emits no structured log events.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web**: Implemented in `packages/web/packages/ui/src/components/option-menu.tsx`. Uses a hand-managed `aria-activedescendant` selection model (tracked in component state) rather than menu roles or roving `tabindex`: DOM keyboard focus stays on the `role="listbox"` container (or the Other `<input>`) while `aria-activedescendant` points at the virtually highlighted option, letting an embedded text input coexist without focus/keyboard conflicts. The component composes `Popover`, `Input`, and `Button` primitives and manages focus via `useRef` and `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure surface focus after arrow navigation. Design tokens: trigger uses `apt-border`/`apt-surface`, `focus-visible` ring `apt-gold/25`, chevron (`ChevronsUpDown`) in `apt-text-muted`; rows highlight with `bg-apt-gold/15`, text `apt-text`, check icon `apt-gold`; OK is `size="sm"`, `variant="default"`; spacing from the `--space-*` scale, corners `--shape-corner-small`, no raw hex, no `!important`. Start from the source and build platform equivalents using the selection model described in Design Decisions.
- **SwiftUI**: Start with a native `Menu` control for the list, but replace with a custom disclosure pattern (e.g., `.popover` modifier) to support the embedded text input in "Other". Hand-manage keyboard navigation via `onKeyPress` callbacks. Use `@FocusState` to track which element should have focus after each navigation action. The selection pattern is the same as web: track highlighted index in state, separate from what is committed.
- **Compose**: Start with `DropdownMenu` for the list, but switch to a custom `Box` with a popover surface for the embedded text input. Implement keyboard navigation via `Modifier.onPreviewKeyEvent` or a custom state machine tracking the highlighted selection. Use `FocusRequester` to move focus between the input and the list after arrow keys. Match the web component's separation of selection (transient highlight) from commitment (firing `onChange`).
- **AppKit / UIKit**: On iOS (UIKit), use `UIMenu` as the menu overlay, but compose a custom `UIViewController` or a SwiftUI overlay to support the "Other" text input; manage keyboard shortcuts via the responder chain and `UIKeyCommand`. On macOS (AppKit), use an `NSPopover` containing the list and input, and manage arrow/Enter/Escape handling via the responder chain's `keyDown(with:)` and `NSEvent`, not `UIKeyCommand` (an AppKit-only surface has no `UIKeyCommand`). The critical invariant is the same across all platforms: selection moves independently of commit, and only commit fires the `onChange` callback.
- **WinUI 3**: Use a `Flyout` (not `MenuFlyout`, which cannot host a `TextBox`) for the list surface. For the "Other" input, embed a `TextBox` in the flyout with a `Button` for OK. Implement keyboard navigation via `PreviewKeyDown` events on the flyout, tracking selection in app state. Ensure focus management transitions focus between list items and the input as appropriate. The selection/commitment model must match the source: the highlighted selection never fires `onChange`, only user intent (Enter, click, or OK click) does.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: Hand-manage the selection (highlighted row) in component state, independent of DOM focus, instead of building on `DropdownMenu` / Base-UI menu roles.
**Rationale**: Menu roles hijack typeahead and focus and fight an embedded text input; tracking selection in state lets arrow keys work whether DOM focus is on the listbox surface or in the Other input.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Keep selection and commit distinct — selection is a transient highlight that never fires `onChange`; only a commit (Enter, OK, row click) fires `onChange` and closes.
**Rationale**: Lets users browse the list with arrow keys (including into and out of the Other input) without side effects, so only a deliberate action commits a value.
**Approved**: pending

`keyboard-navigable` and `focus-management` pass on the trigger's Enter/Space/ArrowDown activation, the full arrow/Enter/Escape/OK keyboard model, and focus returning to the trigger on close. `screen-reader-support` and `semantic-markup` are partial because the source's Other row is a `role="option"` that contains a focusable `<input>` and `<button>`, a nesting that departs from a plain listbox/option tree (see Accessibility). `no-hardcoded-strings` fails because the OK button's label is hard-coded with no prop (see Localization). The keyboard-nav/selection state machine is defined as local functions inline in the component body rather than an extracted hook (separation-of-concerns: partial), while `optionMenu.test.tsx` renders `OptionMenu` and exercises arrow-nav commit, click commit, Escape, and the Other-row input with real assertions (unit-test-coverage: passed).
