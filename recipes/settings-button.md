# Settings Button

## Overview

The Settings Button is a React button component in the `user-settings` control family (`packages/web/packages/controls/src/user-settings/components/SettingsButton.tsx`) that provides a flexible foundation for button controls. It accepts all standard HTML button attributes and supports visual variants through CSS class naming under the `aws-` prefix — this toolkit's CSS namespace for library-authored classes (e.g. `aws-button`, `aws-button--primary`). The component is designed to accommodate application-specific styling via CSS classes while maintaining semantic HTML button structure.

## Behavioral Requirements

- **render-as-button**: Component MUST render as a standard HTML `<button>` element.
- **accept-html-attributes**: Component MUST accept and pass through all standard HTMLButtonElement attributes (onClick, disabled, aria-*, data-*, etc.) via rest props.
- **support-children**: Component MUST render the `children` prop if provided; children MAY be text nodes or React elements.
- **apply-base-class**: Component MUST always include the CSS class `aws-button` on the rendered button element.
- **apply-variant-class**: Component MUST apply a variant-based CSS class in the format `aws-button--{variant}` where variant is the value of the `variant` prop.
- **default-variant**: Component MUST default the `variant` prop to `'primary'` when not provided.
- **closed-variant-set**: Component's `variant` prop MUST be constrained to the closed set `'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive'` (the `SettingsButtonVariant` type), so no other string is assignable.
- **default-type**: Component MUST default the HTML `type` attribute to `'button'` when not provided.
- **merge-classname**: Component MUST combine `aws-button`, the variant class, and any custom `className` prop using whitespace separation, filtering out falsy values.

## Appearance

- **Background**: Determined by CSS classes (`aws-button`, `aws-button--{variant}`); component does not define inline styles.
- **Text/Foreground**: Determined by CSS classes; component does not define inline styles.
- **Border**: Determined by CSS classes; component does not define inline styles.
- **Padding**: Determined by CSS classes; component does not define inline styles.
- **Font**: Determined by CSS classes; component does not define inline styles.
- **Corner radius**: Determined by CSS classes; component does not define inline styles.
- **Shadow**: Determined by CSS classes; component does not define inline styles.

## States

| State | Appearance change |
|-------|------------------|
| Default | Appearance determined by CSS class set (`aws-button`, `aws-button--{variant}`) |
| Hover | Determined by CSS `:hover` pseudo-class applied to the button element |
| Focus | Determined by CSS `:focus` or `:focus-visible` pseudo-class applied to the button element |
| Active/Pressed | Determined by CSS `:active` pseudo-class applied to the button element |
| Disabled | Determined by CSS `:disabled` pseudo-class applied to the button element; appearance changes triggered by the `disabled` HTML attribute |

## Accessibility

- **Role**: Implicit button role from native HTML `<button>` element.
- **Label requirements**: Component MUST receive accessible text content either as children (text nodes or elements with text content) or via `aria-label` attribute passed through rest props.
- **Button type**: Component uses semantic HTML button element, providing built-in keyboard support (Space and Enter keys trigger the button in user agents).
- **Custom attributes**: All ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-pressed, aria-expanded, etc.) MUST be passable via rest props and applied to the button element.
- **Minimum tap target**: Minimum tap/click target size is determined by CSS styling applied via the `aws-button` and variant classes; the component enforces no minimum size in code.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| settings-button-001 | render-as-button | No props | Renders `<button>` element in DOM |
| settings-button-002 | default-variant | No variant prop | CSS class `aws-button--primary` is present |
| settings-button-003 | default-type | No type prop | Rendered button has `type="button"` |
| settings-button-004 | apply-base-class | No props | CSS class `aws-button` is present |
| settings-button-005 | apply-variant-class | variant="secondary" | CSS class `aws-button--secondary` is present |
| settings-button-006 | merge-classname | className="custom-class", variant="primary" | Rendered button has classes `aws-button aws-button--primary custom-class` |
| settings-button-007 | support-children | children="Click me" | Rendered button contains text content "Click me" |
| settings-button-008 | support-children | children={<span>React element</span>} | Rendered button contains the React element as child |
| settings-button-009 | accept-html-attributes | onClick handler, disabled={true} | onClick handler is attached and disabled attribute is applied |
| settings-button-010 | accept-html-attributes | aria-label="Settings" | aria-label attribute is applied to button element |
| settings-button-011 | merge-classname | No className, variant="primary" | Rendered button has classes `aws-button aws-button--primary` (no extra spaces) |
| settings-button-012 | closed-variant-set | `variant={'invalid' as SettingsButtonVariant}` (type-level) | TypeScript compilation fails; `'invalid'` is not assignable to `SettingsButtonVariant` |
| settings-button-013 | default-type | type="submit" | Rendered button has `type="submit"` (default overridden) |
| settings-button-014 | merge-classname | className="", variant="primary" | Rendered button has classes `aws-button aws-button--primary` (empty string filtered out, no extra spaces) |

## Edge Cases

- **Undefined children**: When children prop is undefined, the component renders an empty button element (no text or content).
- **Null children**: When children prop is null, the component renders an empty button element.
- **Empty string className**: When className is an empty string, it is filtered out during class merging and does not appear in the final class list.
- **Multiple CSS classes in className prop**: When className contains multiple space-separated classes, all classes are preserved in the merged output.
- **Falsy values in className**: When className is `false` or `undefined`, it is filtered out during class merging.
- **Type attribute override**: When a custom `type` prop is passed, it overrides the default `'button'` type.
- **Missing children and empty button**: A button with no children and no text content renders as an empty interactive element; visual appearance depends on CSS (which may apply `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements or background images).

## Configuration

Not applicable: the component does not provide a configuration object or settings API. Visual and behavioral configuration is achieved through CSS classes (variant) and HTML attributes (type, disabled, etc.).

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: this component is a UI primitive and does not handle navigation or deep linking independently. Deep linking behavior is the responsibility of parent components or application-level routing.

## Localization

Not applicable: the component does not render static text. All user-visible text is supplied via the `children` prop or `aria-label` attribute, allowing parent components to handle localization.

## Accessibility Options

Not applicable: the component inherits accessibility behavior from native HTML buttons and does not implement display options (Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, Differentiate Without Color). These concerns are addressed by CSS media queries and user agent preferences applied to the button's CSS classes.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: the component does not implement feature flags or conditional rendering based on configuration flags.

## Analytics

Not applicable: the component does not emit analytics events. Analytics tracking is the responsibility of parent components or event listeners attached via the `onClick` handler passed through rest props.

## Privacy

Not applicable: the component does not collect, store, or transmit data.

## Logging

Not applicable: the component does not produce diagnostic logs.

## Platform Notes

- **React/Web**: Implemented in `packages/web/packages/controls/src/user-settings/components/SettingsButton.tsx`. The component extends `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>` to accept all native HTML button properties. CSS class composition uses the `aws-button` base class and `aws-button--{variant}` variant class. The component is marked `'use client'` for server-side rendering contexts that require explicit client component declaration.
- **SwiftUI**: A SwiftUI implementation would start with `Button(action:label:)` or a custom `ButtonStyle` conformance. Key difference: styling is applied via SwiftUI modifiers (`.buttonStyle()`, `.foregroundColor()`) rather than CSS classes. Variants would be implemented as computed properties or separate `ButtonStyle` types (e.g., `PrimaryButtonStyle`, `SecondaryButtonStyle`) applied via the `.buttonStyle()` modifier.
- **Compose**: An Android Compose implementation would use `Button(onClick:)` from `androidx.compose.material3` or a custom composable. Variants would be implemented as function parameters controlling `colors`, `shape`, and `contentPadding` rather than CSS classes. The `enabled` parameter maps to the `disabled` HTML attribute.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: An AppKit implementation would use `NSButton` with a `bezelStyle` (e.g. `.rounded`, `.regularSquare`) and `controlSize`; variants would be implemented as preset `bezelStyle`/`contentTintColor` combinations. A UIKit implementation would use `UIButton` with `UIButtonConfiguration` (iOS 15+) or custom styling via `setTitleColor()` and `setBackgroundImage()`; variants would be implemented as preset `UIButtonConfiguration` instances or separate factory methods. Neither platform has a native equivalent to HTML's `submit`/`reset` button `type` — those are DOM form-submission semantics with no AppKit/UIKit counterpart; the `type` prop's `'button'` default corresponds to an ordinary tap/click action on both platforms.
- **WinUI 3**: A WinUI 3 implementation would use `Button` from `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls` with variants applied via named `Style` resources, not template selectors. Styling is achieved using XAML `<Style>` definitions with `TargetType="Button"` and `x:Key` matching the variant name (e.g., `"PrimaryButtonStyle"`, `"SecondaryButtonStyle"`). The component's `Style` property binds to `{StaticResource PrimaryButtonStyle}` by default. Content is supplied via the `Content` property (XAML child element); `Padding` and `CornerRadius` are ordinary dependency properties on `Button` (not attached properties) that control spacing and shape. Custom properties (equivalent to React props) are implemented as `DependencyProperty` on a wrapper control or as template parameters passed to a custom control template.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: Extend `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>` (minus `children`) and pass all rest props through to the rendered `<button>`, rather than defining a narrow, enumerated prop interface.
**Rationale**: Lets consumers use any native button capability (data attributes, ARIA, event handlers) without the component needing to enumerate them, keeping the component decoupled from visual design decisions.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Style entirely through CSS class names (`aws-button`, `aws-button--{variant}`) rather than inline styles or a styling library; the `variant` prop is a convenience that encodes the `aws-button--{variant}` naming convention while still permitting direct `className` manipulation for advanced customization.
**Rationale**: Keeps the component decoupled from visual design decisions and lets consuming teams define variants in their own stylesheets under the toolkit's `aws-` CSS namespace.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Default the `type` attribute to `'button'` rather than inheriting the native HTML default (`'submit'`).
**Rationale**: Prevents accidental form submission when the button is rendered outside an explicit form context, while still letting consumers override it via the `type` prop.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Omit `children` from the `ButtonHTMLAttributes` extension (`Omit<ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, 'children'>`) and declare it as an explicit, typed component prop instead.
**Rationale**: Avoids a type conflict between the HTML attribute's `children` typing and the component's own `ReactNode` children parameter; this is a type signature concern rather than a runtime behavior, so it has no separate runtime test vector (see conformance test vector settings-button-012 for the analogous type-level check on `closed-variant-set`).
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [screen-reader-support](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#screen-reader-support) | passed | Accessibility |
| [keyboard-navigable](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#keyboard-navigable) | passed | Accessibility |
| [semantic-markup](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#semantic-markup) | passed | Accessibility |
| [touch-target-size](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#touch-target-size) | partial | Accessibility |
| [contrast-ratio](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/accessibility#contrast-ratio) | partial | Accessibility |

The native `<button>` element with full ARIA/rest-prop passthrough satisfies screen-reader-support, keyboard-navigable, and semantic-markup; touch-target-size and contrast-ratio are partial because sizing and color are delegated entirely to the `aws-button`/`aws-button--{variant}` CSS classes, which are outside this source file.
