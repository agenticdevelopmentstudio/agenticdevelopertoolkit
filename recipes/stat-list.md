# StatList

## Overview

`StatList` and `StatListRow` in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui` are the shared **status list** — a
vertical stack of "tone dot + truncating label + trailing figure" rows. It is the
fleet/telemetry idiom: a monitor's *down sites* (name · duration), a card's *top
error issues* (title · count · deep link). Each row is a `StatusDot` (size 7) at the
family tone, a `min-w-0 flex-1 truncate` label, and a right-aligned `shrink-0`
trailing slot the caller fills (a bold duration, a count plus an `ExternalLink`).

It was extracted because that exact row + list grammar was hand-rolled
character-identically in the fleet status site (`MonitorCard`), the status backend's
telemetry cards (`TelemetrySections`), and the ui-showcase — the "same markup twice →
extract it" rule. `StatList` owns the list wrapper (an optional top divider + the
row gap); `StatListRow` owns one row. Both are **pure assembly** — the only visual
primitive is the shared `StatusDot`; everything else is layout + the caller's text.

## Ingredients

| Name | Domain | Role | Required | Configuration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| StatusDot | agenticdevelopertoolkit://recipes/status-dot | The leading tone dot on each row (size 7), decorative (no aria label — the row's text carries the meaning) | yes | `tone` per row from `StatListRow.tone`; fixed `size={7}` |

`StatListRow`'s label and trailing content are caller-supplied `ReactNode`s, not
components this block owns; `StatList` is a bare wrapper element.

## Integration Requirements

- **must-render-a-dot-per-row**: `StatListRow` MUST render a decorative `StatusDot` (size 7, no accessible label) at its `tone` as the row's leading glyph.
- **must-truncate-the-label**: `StatListRow` MUST render `label` as a `min-w-0 flex-1 truncate` element and MUST set its native `title` to `labelTitle` when provided, so a clipped label is still readable on hover.
- **must-right-align-trailing**: When `trailing` is provided, `StatListRow` MUST render it right-aligned and non-shrinking after the label; when absent, it MUST render no trailing slot.
- **must-honor-row-element**: `StatListRow` MUST render as a `li` when `as="li"` and a `div` otherwise, so a semantic list uses `ul`/`li`.
- **must-stack-rows**: `StatList` MUST arrange its children in a single vertical `gap-1.5` column with `list-none`.
- **must-divide-when-asked**: `StatList` MUST add a top border + padding when `divided` is set (the list sits under card content) and MUST omit them otherwise.
- **must-honor-list-element**: `StatList` MUST render as a `ul` when `as="ul"` and a `div` otherwise.
- **must-spread-host-attributes**: Both MUST spread remaining host attributes (`data-*`, `id`, handlers) onto their root element so hosts can tag them (e.g. the fleet `data-testid="down-list"`).

## Layout

```
StatList  (as="ul" divided)
--- divider (border-t) --------------------------------------
 (dot) app · production        (truncates…)             1h
 (dot) worker queue            (truncates…)            12m
        ^ StatusDot   ^ min-w-0 flex-1 truncate label   ^ trailing (shrink-0)
```

- Row: `flex items-center gap-2 font-mono text-[11px]` — dot, then the truncating
  label, then the trailing group.
- Trailing group: `inline-flex shrink-0 items-center gap-2` so multiple trailing
  bits (a count + a deep link) space consistently.
- List: `flex list-none flex-col gap-1.5`, plus `border-t border-apt-border pt-2.5`
  when `divided`.
- No raw hex, no `!important` — color via `apt-*` tokens and the composed StatusDot.

## Shared State

Both components are pure and stateless — every prop flows down into layout or the
composed `StatusDot`; nothing flows back up.

| State | Source | Consumer | Direction | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tone` | Caller | StatusDot | Down | Prop pass-through |
| `label` / `labelTitle` | Caller | Truncating label element | Down | Prop |
| `trailing` | Caller | Trailing slot | Down | Prop (rendered when non-null) |
| `as` / `divided` | Caller | Root element + wrapper classes | Down | Prop |
| host attributes (`data-*`, `id`) | Caller | Root element | Down | Rest-prop spread |

## Integration Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | must-render-a-dot-per-row, must-truncate-the-label, must-right-align-trailing | `<StatListRow tone="error" label="app" labelTitle="app" trailing={<span>1h</span>} />` | a decorative dot, a truncating label with `title="app"`, and "1h" in a shrink-0 trailing slot |
| T2 | must-truncate-the-label | label longer than its box | label carries `min-w-0 flex-1 truncate` |
| T3 | must-right-align-trailing | `StatListRow` with no `trailing` | no trailing slot element rendered |
| T4 | must-honor-row-element | `as="li"` | the row is an `li` |
| T5 | must-stack-rows, must-divide-when-asked, must-honor-list-element | `<StatList as="ul" divided>` | a `ul` with `flex-col gap-1.5` and a `border-t`/`pt-2.5` divider |
| T6 | must-divide-when-asked | `<StatList>` (no `divided`) | no `border-t` on the list |
| T7 | must-spread-host-attributes | `<StatList data-testid="down-list">` | the root carries `data-testid="down-list"` |

## Edge Cases

- **No `trailing`**: the row is dot + label only (a bare status line); the trailing
  slot is omitted entirely.
- **Decorative dots**: the dot never carries an aria label — the row's own text
  (label + trailing) is the accessible content, so a screen reader reads the item
  once, not "status" twice.
- **`labelTitle` vs `label`**: pass the plain-text form as `labelTitle` so the native
  tooltip works even when `label` is rich `ReactNode`.
- **Multiple trailing bits**: wrap them in the `trailing` prop (a fragment); the
  block's `inline-flex gap-2` trailing wrapper spaces them (e.g. `24×` + a deep link).
- **`as` mismatch**: use `as="li"` rows only inside an `as="ul"` StatList to keep the
  list semantics valid.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: Not applicable — this is a web/React component. On Apple platforms, build an equivalent using a vertical `VStack` of rows, each with an `HStack` containing a decorative status indicator (via `Circle` or a custom view), a truncating text label with `.lineLimit(1)` and `.truncationMode(.tail)`, and a trailing value view.
- **Compose**: Not applicable — this is a web/React component. On Android, compose rows using a `Column` with `verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy()`, each row a `Row` containing a leading status dot, a `Text` with `maxLines = 1` and `overflow = TextOverflow.Ellipsis`, and a trailing value.
- **React/Web (TypeScript)**: `packages/web/packages/ui/src/blocks/stat-list.tsx`, exported from `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui` (`@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui/blocks/stat-list`). Composes `StatusDot` (`../components/status-dot`). Exports `StatList`, `StatListRow`, `StatListProps`, `StatListRowProps`. Demo in `ui-showcase` Topic `stat-list` (group "Blocks — cards & sections"); regenerate `sources.generated.ts` via `gen-sources.py` after source changes. Rows truncate their label to fit any width; verify at 375 / 768 / 1440 that the trailing figure stays visible while the label clips.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: Not applicable — this is a web/React component. On macOS and iOS, build an equivalent using `NSStackView` (AppKit) or `UIStackView` (UIKit) with vertical axis, each row a horizontal stack containing a decorative status badge, a truncating label with `lineBreakMode = .byTruncatingTail`, and a trailing value.
- **WinUI 3**: Build the list using a vertical `StackPanel` (Orientation="Vertical"); each row is a horizontal `StackPanel` containing a status indicator (`Ellipse` or custom control), a `TextBlock` with `TextTrimming="CharacterEllipsis"` for label truncation, and a right-aligned trailing content region. Ensure the label container has `TextWrapping="NoWrap"` and constrained width to force ellipsis behavior; place trailing content in a `StackPanel` with Orientation="Horizontal" and HorizontalAlignment="Right".

## Design Decisions

- **Decision**: split into `StatList` (wrapper) + `StatListRow` (row) rather than one
  data-driven component. **Rationale**: the two real call sites differ only in the
  trailing content (a bold duration vs a count + deep link); a `trailing` slot keeps
  the row declarative for the common part while letting each site own its tail without
  a config explosion.
- **Decision**: the dot is always decorative (no aria label). **Rationale**: the row's
  visible label + trailing already convey the item; labeling the dot too would make a
  screen reader announce the status twice — the same a11y trap the StatusDot adapter
  fix addressed.
- **Decision**: `divided` is a boolean, not a caller-supplied className. **Rationale**:
  both sites use the identical `border-t border-apt-border pt-2.5` treatment when the
  list sits under card content; a named flag keeps that one decision in the block.
- **Decision**: `as` picks the element (`ul`/`li` vs `div`). **Rationale**: a monitor's
  down sites ARE a semantic list, while a card's freeform tail may not be; the block
  supports both without forcing list semantics where they don't fit.
