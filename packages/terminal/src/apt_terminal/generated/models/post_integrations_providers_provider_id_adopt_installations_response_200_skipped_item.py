    Attributes:
        installation_id (str):
        account_login (str): The account the app is installed on — the org whose repositories it reaches.
        target_type (str): `Organization` or `User`.
        connection_id (Union[Unset, str]): The connection holding it — set when this call made one, AND when a previous
            call already had. Adoption is idempotent, so a second call over the same installations reports them connected
            rather than connecting them again.
        skipped (Union[Unset, str]): Why it was not connected. Absent on success.
        warning (Union[Unset, str]): The connection stands, and the prefetch that rides along behind it — caching what
            this installation was granted — did not finish. NOT a skip: everything that needs a connection works, and only
            the repository picker opening instantly does not. It is reported because this call is what the Test button runs,
            and a picker that will open empty should say so now rather than at the moment somebody needs it.
