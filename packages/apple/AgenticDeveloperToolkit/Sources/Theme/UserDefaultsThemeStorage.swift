/// have no such system — a single-window utility, an iOS app whose only
/// preference *is* the theme — and were each about to write this same forty
/// lines. `UserDefaults` is the platform's own answer for exactly that
/// (`native-controls`), so it lives here once.
///
/// The keys are the same two the AgenticToolkit host writes through its own
/// settings system (`theme.custom_themes`, `theme.active_theme_id`) and the
/// encoding is the same JSON, so a host that later grows a settings system and
/// swaps this out for its own conformer finds the user's themes where it left
