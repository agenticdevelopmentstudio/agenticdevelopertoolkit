///
/// `NSSplitViewController`'s own implementation answers for divider `i` by
/// consulting the items on *both* sides of it — `i` and `i + 1` — and indexes
/// `splitViewItems` unguarded. So the interesting indices are the two the
/// override has to refuse before super sees them: the empty array AppKit asks
/// about while it measures a split view inside `viewDidLoad`, and the
/// `i == count - 1` that a pane removal produces, where AppKit still asks about
/// the divider whose second item has just gone away. A removal caught one beat
/// earlier produces a third: divider `-1`, which super indexes unsigned.
