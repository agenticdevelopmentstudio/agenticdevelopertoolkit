/// This class also reacts to changes made *outside* `selectTheme(id:)` — a
/// settings panel bound straight to the underlying setting, or a sync arriving
/// from another device — via `storage.onExternalChange`, which it hooks in
/// `init` to call `reload()`. Without that hook, such a change persists but
/// nothing repaints until relaunch.
///
/// Platform-neutral by construction: everything AppKit-shaped lives behind
/// `ThemeAppearanceDriver`, the same seam shape `ThemeStorage` uses for
/// persistence. macOS callers get `AppKitAppearanceDriver` installed for them
/// by `init(storage:)`; see `AppKitAppearanceDriver.swift`.
