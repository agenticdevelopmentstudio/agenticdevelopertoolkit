/// ``APITransport`` (Direct or Daemon) to the typed surface and attaches
/// either the ``AuthenticationMiddleware`` (bearer-only) or the
/// ``SessionRefreshMiddleware`` (bearer + refresh-and-retry) so every request
/// carries the bearer token. The generated client is exposed directly as
/// ``api`` — consumers call the full, typed API through it (e.g.
/// `client.api.postAuthLogin(...)`).
///
/// The transport is the only point of variation: Direct and Daemon produce an
/// identical `Client`, differing only by the `(serverURL, transport)` pair the
/// ``APITransport`` carries. Pick one explicitly via ``direct(credentials:)`` /
/// ``daemon(credentials:)``, or let ``TransportResolver`` choose at runtime.
