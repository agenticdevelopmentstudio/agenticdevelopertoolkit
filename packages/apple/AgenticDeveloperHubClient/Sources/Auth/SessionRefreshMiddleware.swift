/// work as a plain `await` inside this actor method still gives one
/// refresh per wave: Swift only interleaves other calls to this actor at
/// the leader's suspension points, and by its first `await` the leader has
/// already recorded `leaderToken`, so every follower that reaches this
/// method afterward sees it and queues instead of racing to lead.
