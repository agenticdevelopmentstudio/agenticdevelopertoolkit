/**
 * The gear that opens a menu of actions on a list, in a rail header or a home bar.
 *
 * It exists as its own component for one reason: it is the fleet's SIGN for "the verbs that
 * act on this list live here", and a sign only works while every instance of it looks the
 * same. `CategoryGearMenu` had the only one, styled inline; the second host would have
 * copied those classes and the two would have drifted apart on the next token change.
 *
 * Deliberately just the trigger — the items are the host's, because what a gear offers depends
 * on the list it acts on. Where two lists do offer the same verbs (a notes list and a documents
 * list narrowing by category and tag), the layer that knows both lists shares those ITEMS; the
 * sign itself stays item-free. Compose it inside a `DropdownMenu` with your own
 * `DropdownMenuContent`.
