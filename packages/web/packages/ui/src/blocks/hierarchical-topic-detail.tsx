   *
   * That default is right for a stack whose detail is a data browser, a form or anything behind
   * auth — there is nothing to render on the server and nothing that wants indexing. It is wrong
   * for a stack whose detail IS the page's content: a documentation or topic browser that renders
   * no prose on the server is invisible to a crawler and blank without JavaScript, and no test
   * catches it because a client-side render always populates the host.
   *
   * When true, the detail also renders as ordinary children of the active stack's detail slot for
   * exactly as long as the portal host does not exist — the server pass and the hydrating client
   * render, which produce identical markup. The layout effect then creates the host, this seed
   * unmounts, and the portal takes over the same DOM position. The handoff is invisible: it lands
   * in the commit BEFORE the browser paints, and it remounts {@link DetailCrossfade} with an
   * unchanged token, which that component reads as "a remount of the same detail" and does not
   * fade.
   *
   * It is opt-in rather than the default because the seed's one visible consequence — content in

   * has no way to relocate a subtree between parents while preserving it, so on the commit after
   * mount the detail runs cleanup and then setup AGAIN — effects re-fire, `useState` initialisers
   * re-run, refs are re-attached, a `<video>` restarts, an uncontrolled `<input>` loses what was
   * typed. That is harmless for content read out of props, which is what a topic browser's detail
   * is; it is not harmless for a detail that initialises anything in a mount effect (opening a
   * socket, starting a timer, POSTing an analytics event — which fires twice) or that keeps state
   * only in itself. Such a detail should either lift that state to the owner, so the remount is a

  // a selection-dependent floor could flip the stack on the click itself, and the lost selection
  // then lowered the floor the decision was re-made on and bounced it straight back to wide.
  //
  // The floor is also never allowed BELOW phone width, whatever the host asked for. `minDetailWidth`
  // is a request about the DETAIL pane; read as the whole mode's threshold it let a host declare,
  // without meaning to, that two panes side by side are fine at 320px. shipr passing `24rem` (288px

  // REMOUNT it on every wide↔narrow or covered↔minimized flip, resetting whatever state lives in
  // `children` (a data browser's schema/table choice, a half-typed form) and unregistering any
  // levels those children publish. That loss is what the flip must never cause: back when
  // `wideFloor` still varied with the selection it even bounced the mode straight back to wide (the
  // lost selection lowered the floor the narrow decision was made on). So the detail renders through a
  // PORTAL into this frame-owned, layout-neutral (`display: contents`) element, and the layout
  // effect below re-slots that element into whichever stack is active: the flip MOVES the
  // detail's DOM, React state intact.

  // initializer runs during RENDER: `typeof document` is undefined on the server and defined on the

  // does NOT skip portals while hydrating — it descends into the container and expects to find
  // markup matching the portal's children there. This container was created microseconds earlier
  // and is empty, so the trees diverge and React throws away the entire server tree and regenerates
  // it on the client. That is expensive, and it re-creates every host node the document already
  // had — including any <script> in the consumer's <head>, which React refuses to create
  // client-side ("Encountered a script tag while rendering React component"). An effect runs AFTER
  // the commit, so the first client render returns the same `null` the server did and hydration
  // matches.
  //
  // Layout, not passive, so the extra render is flushed before the browser paints and the detail is

 * thing you actually see: shipr's `Projects` rail holds `adh` and `sites`, wants 73px, and was

 * — 144px of slack on a two-word column, on every rail, forever, because the pool was also
 * sticky and an unmounted rail still counted. Auto-sizing that never sizes anything down is
 * not auto-sizing (Mike).
 *
 * The movement it was buying against is smaller than it looks. Rails lay out left to right, so
 * a rail changing width moves only the rails to its RIGHT — which are exactly the lists that
 * just changed because of the selection that resized it. Everything left of the selection, the

          left shadow turns on when its parent (the frontier list) is covered, so the overlap reads
          as physical (token colour via a CSS var, so the colour checker stays clean).

          Its right edge is PINNED (`right: 0`), not computed: a JS `containerW - detailLeft` width
          is a measurement from the previous commit, so while the window is being dragged the pane
          is always one frame behind the edge it is supposed to sit on — the width visibly wanders.
          Anchoring both edges makes the browser solve `width` from the live container on every
          frame, for free and exactly. `left` is still the only animated edge; width follows it.

          `paneLeft`, not `detailLeft`, precisely because of that pinned right edge: an unmeasured
          `left` past the container's own width solves to a width of ZERO, and this box is inside an
          `overflow-hidden` — so the pre-measurement render doesn't merely sit wrong, it disappears.

/**
 * The NARROW layout — the stack as an iOS `UINavigationController`.
 *
 * When the wide layout is exhausted (a phone, or a window narrowed past the last collapsed strip
 * beside a `minDetailWidth` detail — see the frame's `wideFloor`), the
 * side-by-side model has nothing left to trade: peeks, cover toggles and the hover reveal are all
 * pointer affordances on room that no longer exists. So the view stops being a row of columns and
 * becomes a NAVIGATION STACK — exactly one FULL-WIDTH pane at a time:
 *
 *   [ Regions ]  →  [ Ecosystems ]  →  [ Topics ]  →  [ detail ]
 *
 * The visible pane is the deepest one the selection reaches: the FRONTIER list while it is still
 * being chosen from, and the detail once every level is selected. Selecting **pushes** the next pane
 * in from the right; **Back** (top-left of every pane but the root) pops it back out, clearing exactly
 * the deepest selected level — the same `onClear` the breadcrumb and the wide layout's Back use, so
 * the unsaved-work guard applies identically. The pane behind the top one parallaxes a little (as iOS
 * does) and is `inert` + `aria-hidden`, so only the visible pane is reachable.
 *
 * Panes are rendered for EVERY level (not just the ones in the current path), so a pane exists to
 * slide in from the right before it becomes the top — and a popped pane slides back OUT instead of
 * vanishing. `anim` lags `top` by one frame for the same reason: a pane that mounts already at its
 * final position cannot transition, so we paint it off-screen once, then move it.
