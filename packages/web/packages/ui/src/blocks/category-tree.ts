// Folding the owner's category rows into the FOREST the notebook rail navigates.
//
// The set is a DAG, not a tree: `content.category_edges` holds one row per parent→child
// link, so a category may sit under any number of parents, or none. A fold therefore draws
// some categories in MORE THAN ONE PLACE, and that is the feature — "Q3" filed under both
// "Work" and "Planning" is reachable from either. A node's identity in the rail is
// consequently its PATH, not its id (see {@link CategoryNode.path}); ids repeat.
//
// The edges have real foreign keys now, and the backend refuses the edge that would close
// a cycle, so the defects this fold has to survive are narrower than they were — but not
// gone. A parent id can still name a row that isn't in `rows` (another workspace's, or one
// deleted between the two reads), and a cycle written before that guard existed would still
// be served. The rules:
//
//   * A parent that isn't in `rows` is skipped. A category with NO surviving parent becomes
//     a ROOT — never dropped, because a corrupt link must cost the user the row's
//     PLACEMENT, never its existence, or notes would sit in a category that has vanished.
//   * A cycle is broken where it closes back on the current PATH, and the rows it isolates
//     from every root are re-seeded as roots in row order. So a looped graph still renders
//     every category exactly once at top level, and the walk terminates.
//   * The EXPANSION is capped ({@link MAX_TREE_NODES}) — the expansion, not the row set. A
//     wide DAG has exponentially many paths and a rail that hangs is worse than one that
//     stops drawing, but the rows are what the backend served and there are linearly many
//     of them. So a row's FIRST drawing is always free and only its REPEAT drawings are
//     charged. Truncation therefore costs DEPTH (the tail of one branch's re-expansion),
//     never BREADTH: no top-level category can vanish because another one was wide.
//   * A category's slug is unique WITHIN ITS LEVEL, because `slugify` is not injective and
//     two sibling names can land on one slug (see {@link siblingSlugs}).
