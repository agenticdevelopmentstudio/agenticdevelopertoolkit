// Hierarchical Menu Details View (HMDV) — the VERTICAL nested-menu ("cascading") experiment,
// extracted verbatim from HierarchicalTopicDetail so the HTDV can stay at its pre-experiment
// shape. HMDV is a self-contained copy of the whole HTDV frame (all four stacks); consumers pick
// the cascade via `disclosureStyle="cascading"`. It carries its OWN module `surfaceStates` map, so
// every HMDV surface coordinates disclosure independently of any HTDV surface. The shared public
// row type (`TopicLevel`) is owned by HTDV and consumed from the barrel; this file re-declares it
// privately only so the copy compiles standalone. `PaneExitGuard` is the shared exit-gate type
// from `../hooks/useExitGate`, imported directly rather than re-declared. Delete this whole file
// (and its barrel line) to retire the experiment.

/**
 * The "cascading" disclosure style — a VERTICAL cascade (nested-menu layout).
 *
 * Only the ROOT list is full height, on the left. Every deeper list opens to the RIGHT of its
 * parent, its TOP just under the parent's HEADER bar and the list toolbar beneath it — one
 * header-plus-toolbar step per level, regardless of which row is selected — and its height HUGS
 * its own rows, capped at the container's bottom (its list scrolls past it). So the stack reads as
 * a chain of menus stepping down-and-right, with every list's HEADER and toolbar always visible
 * (the toolbar carries the list's `+`, search and tools). The DETAIL pane is pinned BESIDE the
 * root list at full height, UNDER the deeper lists: the cascade discloses over it like menus over
 * content, and the detail never moves with it.
 *
 * The disclosure INTENT machinery is the covered stack's, unchanged — auto-hide and the `«`/`»`
 * pins, width pressure covering leftmost-first (until the LISTS fit; the detail no longer competes
 * for width), the hover branch reveal. But covering DRAWS differently here: a covered list is
 * never resized or clipped. Covering only shrinks the list's horizontal ADVANCE to CASCADE_INDENT,
 * so its child — painted above it, back-to-front z-order — literally draws over it, obscuring the
 * covered rows' TEXT while their leading icons stay visible. And because the child's top sits at
 * the bottom of the parent's toolbar, what stays visible of a covered list is its full HEADER and
 * toolbar rows, the icon strip of its rows, and whatever its child is too short to overdraw:
 *
 *   Workspaces
 *     « Workspace
 *       « Personas
 *         « mike        ← the detail strip
 *
 * The detail strip's `«` IMMERSES the detail — every list (root included) slides off the left edge
 * and the detail takes the whole surface; the strip's `»` brings the stack back.
 *
 * Kept as its own component so either layout can evolve or be deleted independently — the price is
 * the mirrored covering logic, annotated where it is ported verbatim.

/**
 * The NARROW layout — the stack as an iOS `UINavigationController`.
 *
 * When only a detail can fit (a phone, or a window narrowed past one list + `minDetailWidth`), the
 * side-by-side model has nothing left to trade: peeks, cover toggles and the hover reveal are all
 * pointer affordances on room that no longer exists. So the view stops being a row of columns and
 * becomes a NAVIGATION STACK — exactly one FULL-WIDTH pane at a time:
 *
 *   [ Regions ]  →  [ Ecosystems ]  →  [ Topics ]  →  [ detail ]
 *
 * The visible pane is the deepest one the selection reaches: the FRONTIER list while it is still
 * being chosen from, and the detail once every level is selected. Selecting **pushes** the next pane
 * in from the right; **Back** (top-left of every pane but the root) pops it back out, clearing exactly
 * the deepest selected level — the same `onClear` the breadcrumb and the wide layout's Back use, so
 * the unsaved-work guard applies identically. The page's swipe-back gesture, offered to the stack
 * under the finger (lib/swipe-back.ts), runs that same Back whenever one is showing. The pane
 * behind the top one parallaxes a little (as iOS does) and is `inert` + `aria-hidden`, so only the
 * visible pane is reachable.
 *
 * Panes are rendered for EVERY level (not just the ones in the current path), so a pane exists to
 * slide in from the right before it becomes the top — and a popped pane slides back OUT instead of
 * vanishing. `anim` lags `top` by one frame for the same reason: a pane that mounts already at its
 * final position cannot transition, so we paint it off-screen once, then move it.
