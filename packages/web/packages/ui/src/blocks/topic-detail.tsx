   * MEASURE THE ROWS, before paint.

   * question worth asking, "how wide would you be if nothing constrained you" — read, and put
   * back inside the same layout effect, so no frame is ever painted with it. Reading
   * `scrollWidth` alone would only ever say "the content OVERFLOWS", never "the content has
   * room to spare", so it could widen a rail and never narrow one.
   *
   * Each measurement costs ONE forced layout — every write, the list's and the header's, lands
   * before the first read (see `measure`) — and a run measures twice, now and again when the
   * fonts land: two forced reflows per rail per run, which is what the notes on `sig` and
   * `onFitRef` below are counting.
   *
   * `sig` deliberately does not include the labels: a row keeps its identity when its label
   * is re-rendered, and the alternative — re-measuring on every render that rebuilt an equal
   * array — costs two forced reflows per rail for a width that did not move.

 * The rail is ALWAYS collapsible (a core part of the site design, not a config

 * strip for more pane room — each topic stays clickable as its icon, the active
 * icon keeps the gold selection bar, and the header `+` stays put.
