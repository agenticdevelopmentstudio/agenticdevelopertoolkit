/**
 * The cascading menu view's DECISIONS, extracted from the component as pure data + pure functions.
 *
 * Why this file exists: every rule in here was reported as a bug, fixed, and then REGRESSED by a
 * later fix — because each one lived as a boolean expression tangled into a 3000-line component
 * where nothing named it and nothing could test it. A behaviour that has a rule id here cannot
 * silently regress: it fails a test (`cascadeRules.test.ts`, citing the recipe rule it implements —
 * `recipes/hierarchical-topic-detail.md`, "Cascading view — motion, ground and the selection
 * chain").
 *
 * v1.16.0 rebuilt the interaction layer around the STORED state machine below (`CascadeMode`).
 * The previous architecture re-derived the menu geometry on every render and defended the
 * derivation with six accumulated freeze mechanisms (a ground latch, a covering pressure freeze, a
 * frozen-frontier ratchet, an entry-gated trigger, a pointer-evidence clause, a covered-column
 * enter) whose release edges raced each other, the route remount and the live animations — each
 * fix regressed a neighbouring path, which is exactly the history the paragraph above describes.
 * Now the mode is a VALUE: while a gesture is engaged the base geometry is frozen data, a click is
 * not a settling event (unrepresentable, not intercepted), and the final choice is DECLARED by the
 * host rather than inferred from renders.
 *
 * Nothing in this module touches the DOM or React — it is the arithmetic and the policy only, so
 * `cascadeRules.test.ts` covers it exhaustively without a layout engine (jsdom has none, which is
 * exactly why the geometry-dependent half of the component was never testable).

// ─── The selection chain: ONE line ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The selection chain's ONE stroke weight, in CSS px (**draw-one-chain-line**).
 *
 * THREE things draw this line and they must be indistinguishable:
 *   1. a selected row's gold left bar — `border-l-2` in `topic-detail.tsx`;
 *   2. the gold rail down an unchosen submenu's left edge — the `<span>` in the cascade;
 *   3. the elbow connectors joining a selected parent row to its child — an SVG stroke.
 *
 * It is 2, and it is 2 BECAUSE of (1): Tailwind's `border-l-2` is the row indicator that has always
 * shipped, so the other two match IT rather than the reverse. The previous value (1.5) was chosen to
 * match the connector's stroke and made things worse — it left the row bar at 2 and disagreeing with
 * both, and a 1.5px line cannot render honestly anyway: it is anti-aliased across 2–3 device pixels
 * at partial alpha, so it reads DIMMER as well as thinner. Two whole pixels land on the grid.
 *
 * That anti-aliasing is also why `SelectionConnectorOverlay` sets `shape-rendering: crispEdges`.
 * Every connector path is axis-aligned (horizontal runs + vertical elbows), so snapping to the pixel
 * grid costs nothing and is the only way an SVG stroke can match a CSS border's crispness — same
 * token (`apt-gold`), same width, and now the same coverage, so the same colour reaches the eye.
