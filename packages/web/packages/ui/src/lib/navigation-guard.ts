// The one navigation-guard registry. Guards (e.g. UnsavedChangesGuard) register
// a callback; code that navigates PROGRAMMATICALLY (router.push from a menu
// handler, a keyboard chooser, a logout flow) awaits confirmNavigation() first.
// With no guard registered it resolves true synchronously, so chrome shared by
// every site pays nothing on pages that don't guard.
//
// THE PRIMARY RULE. Several guards are armed at once whenever two independently
// mounted surfaces are both dirty — hub's root layout renders the user-settings
// overlay's guard as a SIBLING of the workspace chrome's, and each publishes its
// own dirtiness. One navigation is one decision, so it raises exactly ONE
// confirm: the FIRST guard still registered (insertion order, which a Set keeps)
// is the primary, and confirmNavigation() asks it alone and returns its answer.
// That is sound because the prompt is generic — "you have unsaved changes, if
// you leave they will be lost" — and Discard means leave and discard EVERYTHING,
// not just this surface. Asking the rest would be asking the same question again.
//
// The primary also owns the Back-button sentinel and the popstate response, so
// Back takes one press and prompts once (see UnsavedChangesGuard). Non-primary
// guards keep their beforeunload listener — the browser coalesces those into one
// native prompt — and their click listener, whose `if (e.defaultPrevented)`
// early return lets the primary's preventDefault de-dupe the anchor path.
//
// Primary status is live, not latched: subscribeNavigationGuards() fires on every
// membership change so a survivor can take over (and arm its own sentinel) the
// moment the primary unregisters.
//
// Anchor clicks are intercepted by UnsavedChangesGuard's document listener
// instead — a component whose anchor handler ALSO navigates programmatically
// (so it would be double-prompted) opts out of the click interception by
// setting GUARDED_NAV_ATTR on the anchor and calling confirmNavigation() in
// its own handler.
