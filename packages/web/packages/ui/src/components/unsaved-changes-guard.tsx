/**
 * Blocks leaving the page while `when` is true. Four exits are guarded:
 *
 * - Hard navigation (reload / tab close / external link) via `beforeunload` —
 *   the browser shows its native leave prompt.
 * - In-app link clicks: a capture-phase document listener intercepts plain
 *   left-clicks on same-origin anchors before the framework's router handler
 *   runs, and raises the platform AlertModal confirm instead. Confirming
 *   navigates via `onNavigate`; cancelling stays put. Anchors marked with
 *   `GUARDED_NAV_ATTR` are skipped — their own handlers consult
 *   `confirmNavigation()` (lib/navigation-guard) instead.
 * - Programmatic navigation that opts in: this component registers itself
 *   with the navigation-guard registry, so chrome that calls
 *   `router.push` (menus, choosers, logout) awaits `confirmNavigation()`
 *   and raises the same confirm.
 * - Browser Back/Forward: while armed and PRIMARY, a same-URL sentinel entry is
 *   pushed so the first Back lands on it (no route change); the confirm is
 *   raised, and discarding re-issues the Back for real. The sentinel is
 *   remembered by the URL it was pushed for, not by a bare "already pushed"
 *   flag: a long-lived mount (the hub's workspace chrome, StandaloneRailHost)
 *   outlives many routes, so re-arming somewhere it has not armed yet has to
 *   push a fresh sentinel, while re-arming at the SAME url must not stack a
 *   second one (that would cost the user two Back presses). Cost of the
 *   technique: after the page goes clean again the consumed-or-not sentinel
 *   may leave one extra same-URL entry — the only reliable way to interpose
 *   on popstate without desyncing the app router.
 *
 * Several of these can be armed at once (hub's root layout mounts the settings
 * overlay's guard as a sibling of the workspace chrome's), and one navigation
 * still gets one confirm. The registry's first-registered guard is the primary;
 * it alone answers `confirmNavigation()`, arms the sentinel and responds to
 * popstate — see lib/navigation-guard for why one generic "discard everything"
 * prompt is the whole answer. The others stay useful without prompting: their
 * `beforeunload` listeners coalesce into the browser's one native prompt, and
 * their click listeners bail on `defaultPrevented` once the primary has
 * intercepted the anchor. Primary status is live, so if the primary disarms
 * while this one is still dirty, this one takes over and arms a sentinel.
 *
 * A surface that navigates as the LAST step of a successful save calls
 * `approveNavigation()` (lib/navigation-guard) first: `when` is still true at
 * that instant — the draft has been persisted, not re-rendered — and every armed
 * guard, this one included, would otherwise veto an exit that loses nothing.
