 * and the component, which is where the last two regressions actually landed.
 *
 * jsdom has NO layout engine: `getBoundingClientRect` is all zeros and `Element.animate` does not
 * exist. So the geometry (rect unions, connector paths, the ground's measured width) cannot be
 * asserted here at all — that is precisely why those decisions were extracted into pure rules. What
 * IS testable here is that a click reaches the right callback, which is the half that broke.
 *
 * The component's animation paths are written to no-op without WAAPI (`typeof col.animate !==
 * "function"` → land in place, run the callback) rather than to throw — a real robustness guard that
 * also makes this file possible.
