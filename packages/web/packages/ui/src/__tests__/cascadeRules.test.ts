 * chain"). Every rule here was reported, fixed, and then REGRESSED by a later fix, which is why the
 * decisions were pulled out of the component into `cascade-rules` and pinned here: the component's
 * geometry needs a layout engine and jsdom has none, so anything left inside it as an expression was
 * untestable by construction, and "untestable" is how each of these quietly came undone.
 *
 * Read the rule ids as the contract. If one of these fails, the fix is NOT to update the assertion —
