/**
 * HierarchicalTopicDetail — the behaviours that are layout/interaction logic:
 *
 *  - the WHOLE-BRANCH hover reveal: hovering a covered list opens that list AND its children as one
 *    cascade, and it stays open while the pointer walks between them;
 *  - the SHRINK sequence: a list slid onto its parent as the container narrows, then off the left
 *    edge when even the peeks won't fit;
 *  - the NARROW layout: one full-width pane at a time, pushed on select and popped by Back.
 *
 * Everything that turns on "is this list covered" needs a container width, because width pressure is
 * the only thing that covers a list — see `installResizeHarness` for the harness that supplies one
 * and for the arithmetic behind the named widths. Enter/leave are dispatched as
 * `pointerover`/`pointerout` with a `relatedTarget`, because that is what React's synthetic
 * onPointerEnter/onPointerLeave are built from (a raw `pointerenter` doesn't bubble to React's root
 * listener).

 *  or not, so the covering is a function of the width alone. What an unselected frontier keeps is
 *  its own exemption: it is never covered or slid off (it is the list being chosen from), and it is
 *  the one rail the last-resort squeeze may narrow past the detail's minimum. Lists are covered

/**
 * THE SWIPE IS THE BACK YOU CAN SEE. The page's flick-right gesture first OFFERS itself at the
 * element under the finger (`offerSwipeBack`, lib/swipe-back.ts) and falls back to
 * `history.back()` only when nothing claims it. That fallback is the wrong answer inside a stack
 * showing a Back: it skips the unsaved-work guard, it leaves the page outright when the host keeps
 * its selection in memory, and on a routed host it lands on whatever entry happens to be previous
 * rather than one pane up. So the stack claims the gesture whenever it shows a Back, and answers it
 * with exactly what that Back runs.
 *
 * The claim itself is shared with HMD's stack (hooks/useSwipeBackClaim.ts, pinned in
 * useSwipeBackClaim.test.tsx); what these pin is that THIS stack hands it the Back it shows,
 * exactly while it shows one.
