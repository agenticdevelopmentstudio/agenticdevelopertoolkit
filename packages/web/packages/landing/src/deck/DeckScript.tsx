 * yet; it lands there via the framework's own `viewport` export, in an order
 * relative to a hand-rendered `<script>` that isn't ours to control. Placed
 * first in <body>, the meta tag it needs is already behind it. (The
 * `addEventListener("load", f)` fallback still catches a miss, but only at
 * `load` — a window during which non-iOS pinch-zoom stays disabled for
 * nothing.)
 *
 * Not a client component: this is a literal <script> tag with an inline body,
 * which is what makes it run before hydration — `useEffect` would be several
 * frames too late for all three.
