    /* A form, not a div, and that is what stops iOS offering "AutoFill Contact"
       above the keyboard. An input with no form ancestor is scoped for autofill
       against the whole DOCUMENT, so Safari classifies it from whatever else the
       page happens to say — on a site with a contact section and an address to
       write to, a lone text field reads as the place to put your details, and the
       keyboard offers the reader's own contact card.

       This was measured on iOS 26, not reasoned about: stripping EVERY attribute
       off the input (name, aria-label, placeholder, autocomplete, the data-*
       opt-outs — down to a bare `<input type="text">`) did not move it, and the
       same markup on a page without contact copy never triggered it at all. What
       fixed it was giving the field a form of its own to be scoped against; the
       classifier then sees a one-field form that asks for nothing.

       The element carries `pc-input-area` unchanged, so it is still the flex bar
       every skin styles — the tag is the only thing that changed. Submitting is
       now a real submit, which is also what `enterKeyHint="send"` has been
       promising the on-screen keyboard all along. */
